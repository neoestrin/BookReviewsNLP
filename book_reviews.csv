"Fascinating view into the past: This book is fascinating for anyone at all interested in New Zealand history or a general account of life in the past. It is surprisingly well written for what is just a series of letters, and gives a real insight into life as a pioneer in the 1860s, with all its highs and lows. You'll laugh at the author's first attempts at baking, and cry with her as she digs dead lambs from a snowdrift. It's a wonderful book and I heartily recommend it.",__label__2
"A very amusing look at the past: I was hoping for far more details about working and handling sheep in the ways the New Zealander's did in the past when I got this book. Unfortunately, this is a collection of letters from a 'high society' girl that was packed up and moved to the NZ outback with her fiancee. Granted, it's amusing and reasonably interesting to read how she sees the world, as well as a bit insightful into how at least one family thought of their slaves and house maids during a time fortunately long behind us.",__label__2
"Didn't like...: I didn't like this version of the song, ""when you believe,"" even though it was the original. I favored the orchestral rendition of this song which was beautifully arranged by Hans Zimmer.",__label__1
"Two Divas,that should shut up!: Here are two songbirds who are trying to be the best singers of all time. I hate this diva routine! I admit they do have maybe one catchy tune.But,this song is so irritating.Two divas trying to hit the highest notes in one song!I give Whitney one star for her almost Josephine Baker look at the Oscars,you looked fine! And her Children song from the 80's. And Mariah for her badly premeditated sexy image and her undying effort to be the best,major ego! Two divas who should SHUT UP!",__label__1
"Movie Version is Much better!: The movie version of this song is much better. The Mariah/Whitney version is simply just a screaming contest to see who can sing better. I admit the song is beautiful and touching, but it would have been better if one of them sung it instead of it being a competition. Buy the soundtrack and listen to the movie version. It showcases the song in a much better light.",__label__1

"Wuzzup, Mariah!?! I'm Kaligirl from Seoul!: ""When You Believe"" is an awesome song. To me Mariah's songs hit me like nukes! The awesome duet performed with Whitney Houston I'll never get sick of. This song(to me) is combined with spiritual, and also relates to the racism. I personally recommend this song to both Kids and Adults!",__label__2
"New Age?: The song is sung beautifully, but is it promoting New Age? Should we believe in ourselves or in God? I think the focus should be more on believing in God and not just in ourselves.",__label__1
"""When you believe"": This song, sung by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey is GREAT! Sometimes, it leaves tears in my eyes. But, the song has some contrasts. Whitney Houston has one of the most beautiful voices in the universe. So when she sings the first verse and chorus, and then Mariah Carey starts to sing the second verse... it's a HUGE CONTRAST! Mariah screeches... If Celine Dion, who has the most wonderfully beautiful voice in the universe, had sung it with Whitney Houston, the song would've been irresistible. It would have been so unexplainable beautiful. Anyway, great job, Mariah and Whitney!",__label__2
"I really like this music because of the words and the story: The singers are very good, both of them has a very nice voice and they are talented singer. I enjoy listening this music very much",__label__2
"Informative: Read it all of it. can not say that I will use any of it. As a woodsman we usually go out already prepared and with our own more modern and durable gear. maybe if I were to live out there and have to replace my goods as they will inevitable need replacing with the suggestions in this book, but seeing as I am a working class man and will not live n the woods it just is good reading and that is all.",__label__2
"Honest old fashioned opinion: I have not placed eyes on the original, but it seems all pictures are correctly placed. His honest old fashioned opinion comes to life when he explains he does not appreciate the safe way to carry his axe. I enjoy the tone and ease of reading, you definitely catch on to the vernacular of the time. A great piece of history that impart practices that still having meaning to this day.",__label__2
"Beginner woodsman manual: This is basically a beginners guide to traveling, camping, and surviving in the woods. Covers a wide variety of topics from cabin building to snowshoeing. My biggest takeaways from the book are to always have an axe and blanket when traveling in the woods. Also, never explore unfamiliar areas without a compass and a means of fire creation.Don't expect a story. This is a manual.",__label__2
Worth it: I thought it was an amazing very well put together book. I really enjoyed it the whole way through not one problem,__label__2
"Impressive character development but mostly morbid.: ""The Magic Barrel"" was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is ""sad,"" that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways.",__label__1
"Wrong title, right author: I selected the complete short stories of Malamud and this book is only a selction of short stories. I was disappointed but we decided to keep it and be more careful in ordering.",__label__1

"An almost-perfect book.: Prof. Jay is a genius. All of the techniques shown in this book works effectively. I use many of them during informal nhb matches and they saved my butt hundreds of times. If only Prof. Jay included some ground-fighting escapes and reversals, then I'll recommend this book to everyone, even to BJJ practitioners.",__label__2
Very well authored: I found this book to be very well authored. It shows what you need to know and gives a very detailed method of teaching you the same technique. Though I think the overuse of wrist locks to be inneffective the overall method is great and proven in competition by wally jay and his students (see the history provided in the book),__label__2
"Good book!!!!!!!!: Great book, techniqes you can use! I love this book, the moves cause pain, but no injury. I really like section on finger locks. I did not have a problem with this book, the pictures were great. If you are in the martial arts, or looking in to them, GET THE BOOK.",__label__2
"small circle jujitsu book review: Great techniques and lots of them. Very good introduction to the world of jujitsu. The issue I had was that many of the pictures were somewhat far away and you can't clearly see how the technique is specifically executed. Also, some of the written descriptions assume baseline knowledge of the technique.",__label__2
Solid technique: The book has great instruction and drills. It is good for those who have a solid foundation with joint locks and submissions and an overall solid grasp of the body and movement. It has given some good variations of techniques I already teach and use.,__label__2
Alot of decent pictures and instructions: As a student of jiujitsu i understood alot of the moves but i found that without previous knowledge these pictures and instructions were difficult to understand. I feel there is alot of good information but not worth buying.,__label__1
Buy a different jujitsu book: I bought it before I knew anything. Now that I have been training a bit more and reading more I realized that this book is lacking a whole lot. I do not really recomend this book unless you can get it for free.,__label__1
"What a strange martial art: I would like to say that I admire any one who puts in the time and effort to learn a martial art and master it. That takes a lot of dedication and hard work. So I really have a great deal of respect for Wally Jay. Having said that though, I think small circle Jujitsu is really an ineffective grappling system. And I also think that it is no good in the street. Reading this book confirmed all of my worst suspicions about this art. Buy it only if you are looking for a good laugh and have money to burn. If not, and you actually want a good book about fighting try anything in Kid Peligro's Brazilian Jiu-jitsu series. Or go buy some Mario Sperry Vale Tudo tapes. Just don't get this book!",__label__1

"A must-have for the Heinlein collector: Gifford is one of the top experts on Heinlein's works, and his ""A Reader's Companion"" is an exhaustively researched and well-thought-out compendium of nearly all of Heinlein's work.I say ""nearly"" only because the book misses a few Heinlein collections and such that have been published in the few years since Gifford's 2000 printing.

It has a great flow to it like all of her music. On this CD I also liked Gently Waves and Soft Grafitti which are both quietly beautiful. I don't think the length of the song should dictate how much you like it, and that's certainly true of Gently Waves.",__label__2
"Two Families Shaped by History: I really enjoyed this book. If you like novels that are vivid and descriptive, that clearly paint life of women in other countries and cultures, then this book is for you. It offers a glimpse of two very different families in El Salvador - rich coffee plantation land owners and peasant coffee pickers/servants. I specifically liked how Benitez had the action and every day life ~ with joy, sorrow, love, births, deaths ~ take place in the context of major historical events. I loved how the ""telenovela"" and its characters took on a life of their own. Anyone who has visited a Latin American country can vouch that they can really take a whole nation by storm! (Just think, how many people in America were waiting to see which David won American Idol?!) As a person of Salvadoran descent it served as middle-age introduction to the tumultuos and rich history of the country and it left me longing to learn more and reconnect with my roots.",__label__2
"disappointing: This is our book group selection this month and I was looking forward to a good read, especially judging by the appealing cover. Ms. Benita is indeed a great story teller and visual with her discriptions,however,the character developmentis sorely lacking. Perhaps this is the point, but why? All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to. Jacinta in particular needed some enchancement. It will be interesting too hear what my fellow book club members think.",__label__1
"Unbelievable!: I am amazed at the high ratings this book received. It was, undoubtedly, the worst book I have ever read. It might have been better with good editing. There were many unimportant characters and many horrible descriptions that could have been omitted. Who really cares about the dogs, many of whom have no relevance to the story. Who really cares about the detailed description of the decor of a room. Yes, I did finish the book that, by the way, had no ending. Toward the middle of the book I actually started editing it. What a mess!",__label__1
the improbable nature of man: Stories from central americal often seem surreal. How could it be that people so rich can live in such close proximity to those so poor? How could people motivated by such high principals commit such barbaric acts of violence? Insulated and liberal in America we so much want to empatize with the poor when in fact we have so much in common with the rich. I found this book so very compelling in that it provided much empathy for all sides of this conflict. One could not demonize any party. Instead I watched helplessly as the events unfolded and greived each needless loss. I recommend this book for your soul as your heart needs the exercise.,__label__2

"True stem-winder of a novel: Really, really awful. The sheer paucity of Alan Dean Foster's imagination is staggering. ""Midworld"" was recommended to me by a friend; at first I thought I was the victim of a bad joke. Could be used as a blueprint on how not to write a novel. Witless, humorless, and lacking in even the slightest glimmer of originality. Don't waste your time.",__label__1

A Peek into Modeling: This is a very fascinating book that lets you see inside the minds of five unique characters (plus Swan herself). It centers around the five amateur models on the shortlist to replace supermodel Swan for a cosmetics campaign. There are so many things going on in this book that it never has time to get boring!

I loved Cyndi's debut, but this album exceeded my expectations, which we all know is rare with most sophomore releases. Although she's Australian, Cyndi has a deep, rich, bluesy voice, that sounds like she grew up in the backwoods of the deep South. This is the quintessential of stripped down, bluesy, country roots music.",__label__2

"Hardy's Dead, but he's still alive in Writing: A compeling and creepy classical fiction to read. It felt like I was doing something wrong by reading Tess, even though I did not have a reason to believe why. But the bottom line's that, from the first chapter until the last, you'll feel as if there's someone standing behind you, ready to hurt you. Your spirit feels free, that's what Thomas Hardy can do to you as a person.",__label__2

A LOOK BACK INTO TIME & ROMANACE: WONDERFUL DISCRIPTIVE NOVEL. HEARTWARMING & HOLDS YOUR INTEREST. HARD TO PUT IN DOWN. WOULD READ IT AGAIN. CREATIVE WRITING BY AN EXCELLENT AUTHOR.,__label__2
"Witty, charming and deliciously hillarious!: After reading Tess of the Durbervilles I could not help but feel a little disapointed when I finished it. I couldn't tear myself away from it. I absolutely adored Tess's manners and her ""cousins"" annnoying manner of Tess's sweet temper. I always wondered wether if Tess and he would get together throughout the entire novel.Boy was I surprised!",__label__2
"Sorely disappointed: The back cover of my book described Tess as a heroine for her time. I was thrilled to begin reading this book to discover what it was that made her a heroine. I was very disappointed by the end of the book. She was no heroine, more like a self-pitying brat! Hardy did a fantastic job of describing life during that periold of time, but that talent was not enough to change my opinion of the book. Very aggrevating!!!",__label__1
"Zzzzzzzzzz.....: TESS is one of the more boring works of literature. Yes, Hardy was rather a revolutionary for the period as far as his choice of heroine and the subjects with which he dealt, but that doesn't necessarily add up to a good book. The story itself isn't bad -- if you're willing to wade through all the unnecessary muck to piece it together. However, I have trouble stomaching the fact that Tess is lauded as a brave and virtuous heroine when she is actually completely spineless and at times rather annoying. I won't spoil the story by giving examples, since you may very well be intending to read it anyway, or being forced to read it for a class. If the latter is so...good luck.",__label__1
"Exhausting: This book has it's place--and that place is in an American Literature course at a university. It was entirely too technical to be enjoyable. I was assigned this book as a ninth grader and now that I am a teacher and understand lexile levels, I must advise other teachers not to assign this book until the later grades--and only to the highest students.",__label__1
"Bit of a Letdown in the End: This is part of my attempt to read classics and non-fiction as well as my usual speculative fiction this year. A few people noted that Hardy is a bit of a hard read, and that turned out to be true. His style is jagged and choppy, bouncing around quite a bit, and never giving you a true glimpse of some scenes important to know how to interpret (such as the question of Tess' seduction or rape by Alec d'Urberville). However, overall, it is an interesting story at least and I enjoyed the book. But considering the ending seemed to be rather ill-fitting to the rest of the tale, I'll have to pass on giving it a high rating. It was rather disappointing to slog through his odd phrasings and quirks, only to be let down at the end by the characters just magically changing personality traits. I think Tess was a weakling without a mind of her own for the most part, Angel was worthless, and the character with the most potential in the story is the so-called villain, Alec d'Urberville.",__label__1
"Most pathetic character in all of literature.: Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the worst books I have ever read. I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it. If you want to read a Hardy book, read Mayor of Casterbridge--it is much better!",__label__1
great book: This is a classic book that I have always loved and now can read on my Kindle. Glad to see it free!,__label__2
"finally! A book that's different.: I don't understand why everyone else who wrote a review didn't like this book. It's one of the weirdest yet greatest books I've read. It's up there in the pile with Jane Eyre! From my point of view, the majority of people who wrote a review where FORCED to read the book in school, and people don't like to be ordered around. I picked this book out myself at a bookstore and thank myself for doing that, it was a last minute decision to buy this book. What teachers should do is recommend books, not make students read them, it kills the interest in a book. This was a nice blend of tragic and weakness. Usually a book has a fierce female fighting the mean, crude, bad man. But this book was different, being a weak girl and innocent man, and being different is just like thinking differently, and that's good.",__label__2
"A True Epic: My favorite book of classic literature, Tess had me crying and begging for more. Hardy unfolds this tale with true genius. Filled with love, hate, depression, and happiness, Hardy does an incredible job of displaying human emotion. I heartily recommend it without second thoughts",__label__2

Glad to be of this century: I didn't like the book. The language was difficult to read and in the end the topic was one i don't agree with.

Makes us appreciate what we have and what those before us had to suffer for us to be where we are now.,__label__1
"Incredible Literary Work: Tess of the d'Urbervilles is an outstanding piece of literature. It follows the struggles of its protagonist through life in the 1900s. Anyone who is interested in literature to the slightest degree must read this novel. It is captivating, spellbinding, and heartwrenching. Rarely do I cry while reading a novel, but I was weeping throughout this book. The incredible journey Tess goes on is unmatched by any other piece of literature to date.",__label__2

(It turns out that pages 14 through 44 are printed twice, resuming at page 77). They may have corrected the problem in other copies, but don't assume that you'll get the whole book!",__label__1
Disappointing: I was really disappointed in this book and surprised that so many people think it is a wonderful story. It was such a depressing story and reflects all of the worst things about the way women were treated in that time. I don't think this story had any redeeming qualities and very few likeable characters (even Tess was quite irritating at times with her pride getting in the way of asking for help to make her life a little easier).,__label__1
"A Classic Theme In Life: I rapidly read this book in high school for a test the next day. I knew that I wanted to read it again because it was so good and I was missing the subleties. I loved it. The theme is that our lives are goverened by what we think of ourselves. Poor Tess was so wrong, but for the times understandable. Hardy writes without including the graphic details, but the story remains. A story that is suspended in time.",__label__2
"Mum's the word, says Victorian novelist.: A question that often appears in agony aunt columns relates to the age old dilemma of telling, or not telling, your spouse about an affair with another. Hardy comes down firmly on the side of keeping it quiet. Tess, with excellent intentions, but misguidedly, spills the beans and comes to a sticky end. As her mother says, she is a 'little fool', though a very disingenuous one, to be sure. But there is much more to this book than that.I first read this book about 40 years ago and have revisited it a few times. It is an immensely powerful, brilliantly written, witty, devastating critique of Victorian morality, religion, and sexual hypocrisy that even today is immensely moving.If Hardy has a weakness, it is in the plotting of his novels, and you have to admit that perhaps there are one too many coincidences, but this is a small quibble.This is one of the greatest of all novels. To me it is right up there with Anna Karenina, so I have to give it five stars.",__label__2

Children and teens continue to be sold and/or directed to a life of drudgey, service or near slavery, if not in fact slavery, by parents knowing no way out of their own dire conditions. That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction. It is all well and good to fasten ones attention on a good resd-but pray do not miss the point! Hypocrisy lives on when the book is finished.",__label__2
Tess of the D'Urbervilles: Once again an excellant service from Amazon. The book is just as I expected. A good quality paper back.R.V.Angel.,__label__2
Classic Thomas Hardy: Perhaps the greatest of the works by Thomas Hardy. It is the story of a tragic heroine whose life is shaped by events beyond her control.I purchased the book for a college class and hope to read more by the author.The descriptions of life in rural 19th century England are superb.,__label__2
"Such a tragically great love story: Absolutely loved the story it's definitely worth reading through. I found some things a little difficult to follow because it's old English, but it was still a great read.",__label__2
"Tess of the D' U rbervilles: I enjoyed reading this classic tragedy. Tess is so sweet you want to know her more and more, which led to shock after shock. I appreciated the footnotes and explanations at the end of the book. I also enjoyed Hardy's colorful descriptions. I was surprised at how similar life in thenineteenth century was to today's life.",__label__2
Best book forced to read......: Out of all the book I was forced to read...I LOVED this one... the movie was good but the book was great...it is the only book I still have from my early Michigan college years.,__label__2
"The worst book i have ever read in my Life: This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away.",__label__1
"Do not read this book!: I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped.",__label__1
Buyer Beware: This was a VERY used paperback of Tess sold as new with library stickers on the binding as well as the front cover. Amazon is definitely not trustworthy anymore.,__label__1

"Boring: I thought this book was long, drawn out, and boring. It was too descriptive. To me, the writing style is a lot like Jane Eyre. I don't particularly like that type of book.Plus, it was way too sad and unrealistic. I don't think THAT many bad things could happen to one person.",__label__1

Trying to get a version of the book that wasnt so diffucult to read, its ok off and on, half the time i dont know what the author is referring to cause it was written so long ago that the author uses that language and it just got in my way of the story, which is why i bought it again thinking the 2nd book looked easier to read but it wasnt...sadly i will be reduced to trying to find the movie to find out what happens and it bothers me because i hate to not finish a book!",__label__1
Good book: This is a good book. It is sad that many of Tess bad decisions caused her life to be worst off than it should have been. Instead of making lemonade from her lemons in life life she continued to suck on the sour sour fruit over and over again.,__label__2
Classical perfection: Tess of the d'Urbervilles is possibly my favorite classic. Thomas Hardy is a brilliant writer as evidened by this novel. If you've never read it please do so. It's free on Amazon. You will fall in love with Tess and curse the life she is dealt.,__label__2
"Excellent!: Several years ago when I was in high school we had to read The Mayor of Casterbridge (also by Hardy). I did NOT enjoy it under the circumstances, but decided to give Tess a try a few years later. I must say, it has certainly become one of my favorite all time books. Hardy really lets the reader see and feel what is happening in the lives of the characters. I must admit that I even shed a few tears at the end (something I rarely do while reading). This book is a must read for anyone who likes literature at all!",__label__2
"Haunting...: I was reading this book for an assignment in English, and the images that it left in my mind will remain there for a long time. The story of Tess, a truly Pure woman, facing adversities that scare the soul out of me, is a thoughtful and saddening one.The Norton Critical edition is particularily good, containing reviews and poems of and about Thomas Hardy, a major advantage when trying to understand the atmosphere that produced this novel.Though the novel is heavy in description, the description is not out of place. In fact, it is essential to the storyline.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and it made me think and reflect on the values that I believe are truly important.",__label__2
"Wonderful: This is a wonderful story, it left me thinking instead of my usual forgetting about it 5 minutes later. The characters are intriging, and the story is interesting, making me not want to put it down. I (being only in high school) would definitly suggest that you read it.",__label__2
"Excellent, timeless analysis of human life and nature: Please ignore the immature high-school student reviews and understand that this book is a masterpiece. Hardy analyzes the relationship between human desire and society's mores to an unprecendented degree. The characters are multi-faceted and very life-like. Hardly aptly avoids the mistake of creating mere carciatures of the pure woman, idealistic intellectual, and spoiled playboy. Moreover, his use of religious allusion is excellent although this may alienate the modern, secular reader. And perhaps this is the problem with some readers. Finally, Tess is an admirable and strong woman who had difficult circumstances. How many people would act as admirably in her circumstance? Not many! The reviewers that criticize her actions should realize this and that they ignore one of Hardy's key points: Don't be so judgemental! This is one of the best books I have read and believe me, I have read a lot of the ""good"" books.",__label__2
"Reality lessons for Thomas Hardy: How nice. Tess is a totally unrealistic character-she has more sorrow in her life then most of us have in a century. This book is extremely sad, and I don't understand why it's a classic. Tess is very happy until her alchoholic dad discovers that they were a noble family, so, getting to big for his britches, he sends Tess over to another D'urberville family, which actually just adopted the name because they wanted to seem influential. That's when the trouble starts. Soon, Tess gives birth to a baby, and goes back home in disgrace. Then she meets another nice guy, who abandons her when he learns of her past. They author could have done with some happpy scenes...life's not all sadness!",__label__1
"KILL ME, PLEASE: either me or the 12 grade teacher who assigned this piece of crap. This book was so terrible no one is my class read it, out teacher would have to come to class with 25 photocopies of the pages we were going over because no one would ""remember"" to bring thier book to class. As a story it was poigent and overdone, as a character, Tess was an insult to women everywhere. She had no backbone unill the end of the novel. fankly, I liked Hardy's poetry better and wish this book would be removed from all required reading list.",__label__1
Bad cover condition: Bad cover. Half of the book is ruined because the spine has come unglued...false product description!,__label__1
Cruel and Depressing Novel: Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.,__label__1
"Once and Twice taken!: After many years of reading and prodding classics in my courses, Tess of the Durbervilles was not at all a book I wanted to read. But obliviously, I had to read it...and Lucky I had to because Tess is one of the best of English literature! Such a masterpiece! Such a creation! Such a tale!",__label__2
Love!: I am collecting the Penguin cloth covered books. These classic books look awesome in a bookcase. I would highly recommend them.,__label__2
"Great classic to read.: I purchased the movie and wanted to read the book also. It is sad as well, as I see life lessons in reading this book. It follows the film exactly, especially the beginning, in my opionion.",__label__2
Great!: Loving the book. Was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner! I can not wait to funish the book. Great price too. Thank you!,__label__2
"Tess by Tess: A sad tale for anyone to read - for a feminist like myself, it was heartbreaking. A classic tale of women's suffering and the unfortunate things that happened before women's rights were liberated. Amazingly written, another triumph for Thomas Hardy.",__label__2
"WARNING - Don't read the Introduction first!: My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1.",__label__1
"THIS BOOK BLOWS: I recommend this book as kindling for a fire. It is the worst book that could have possibly been written. If you want to read this, jump off the nearest bridge or very tall building (without a parachute). That's probably the most similar experience to reading this book. Thank you, and have a good day.",__label__1
"EAYK!: Silly, stupid, boring. I had to read it for a project and I was about to faint. Thank God that it was short:) Do you still wanna read it? Then good luck! I hate to say this but belive me you will be sorry for it!",__label__1
"Daunting but Delightful: My quirky yet brilliant English teacher assigned this work in the beginning of my senior year. Undoubtedly, I approached this book with much doubt and skepticism. If you know Hardy, you immediately recall his superfluity of detail and monotonous landscaping, which inevitably impedes character and plot development. Suprisingly, though all discouraging factors were present, I found the book exceptionally appealing. Hardy's portraiture of Tess validates him as a captivating author. He draws us into her persona, leaving us trampled and bruised with the grievances of life. He walks us through her struggles, though mangled with her inability to step forward, she still persists.I highly reccommend this book to any avid reader of British literature.",__label__2
"so boring.....: the story itself is original(using a common character instead of some nobility), but the story just keeps drugging on forever or something. It is a novel, not a prose!! I wonder why the author had to waste bunch of pages expressing the emotions of the heroin? And I think Tess is terribly idiodic. Why should she continue to love her unforgiving and cruel husband? Isn't that such a degradation of female saying that they will always be loyal to the man no matter how the men desert them? So,do not even try to read this book if you have no time.",__label__1
"Sexist and unsatisfying: See subject line. I would never recommend this book, depth and nuance aside. It was at no point pleasant to read. I struggled to finish it.",__label__1
Waste of time.: I don't care if it's a classic. It went nowhere. There was no point. I could not bring myself to care what happened to the characters. It was not an enjoyable read.,__label__1
"Amazon Affiliate: I wanted to know whether my affiliate link, and commission link worked.It didn't!The book is written in period language, hence I am still in the introductory phase.It is in very small type, which further delays progress.",__label__1
"Tess the Depressed!: I am a Senior at Linville High School. I recently read Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles for my term paper. I chose it because a teacher told me it was very good. I was quite disappointed with the book in general. After reading the description on the back of the book, I inferred that Tess would be confronted with a problem, but being the ""heroine"" she was described as, she would overcome it victoriously. Unfortunately, I was completely wrong. Tess depressed and frustrated me extremely throughout the book. She cowarded down and let people run over her. The only thing that was good was the little surprises inserted every now and then. The whole book depressed me and I would rather not read another book of Hardy's again.",__label__1
Fiction at its Finest: This is a startling book and one in which Tess is forced to make difficult decisions in the face of awful circumstances.,__label__2
"I recommend this: I thoroughly enjoyed Tess, even though it left me raging and gnashing my teeth at times. No picture of Victorian life can be complete without reading this book first.",__label__2
"Classic literature everybody should read: This book is great history lesson, written with love and passion.Young people could learn many good things about relationship between woman and man.",__label__2
"Disappointing: This poor character never catches a break, and the writer makes you care for her, deeply. Emotionally draining and depressing",__label__1

incorrect sewing instructions: There are so many T shirt quilt books out now and my friend happened to choose one that has incorrect sewing instructions. Her quilt would have been easier to make with another book. I have several T shirt quilt books that are very good with instructions.,__label__1
Great book: I used this book to make 3 T-shirt quilts in memory of a friend's 21 year old son and her 2 daughters. They turned out beautifully and looked so much more sophisticated and dignified that the simple sashing method. While the book may be thin it's big on creative ideas. I'm so thankful I found this book for these special quilts! I'm sure I'll be using it over and over again.,__label__2

"Perfect for every Blue's Clues fan and their parents: I was a bit skeptical when I purchased this CD. But my 2 year old is a huge fan of the show, so I took a gamble and that CD doesn't owe me a nickel. It is just as clever as the TV show with the same format. The new songs are entertaining for both of us and the old stand bys are there so he can sing along. It is terrific. The only problem is there is only one ""episode"" on the market. Please hurry and make another one!! I think we know this one by heart!!!",__label__2

"PURE JUNK, FELL APART, DAMAGED MY BIKES: This rack is a piece of junk. Within 1,000 miles, a part has fallen off, the pin bent, the frame sagged, and has rubbed my $2,000 mountain bike frame down to the aluminum. DO NOT BUY THIS RACK.For the initial journey, I put only three bikes on it for a long trip. The weight of the bikes was well below the max allowed. After my first leg, I pulled over to notice the rack sagged significantly. So much so, I removed all bikes to ensure the rack was not failing. I found the pin bent only after 400 miles! As my trip went on, the rack continued to disintegrate. The rubber frame protector holding the frame to my bike fell off (don't ask me how as it was snuggly fitted to my oversized mountain bike frame). The metal to metal rubbing destroyed my paint and rubbed through my hydraulic brake line. My kids' bikes were also rubbed, dented, and scratched.Buy any other rack but this one. I personally will return to a roof rack for all my bikes.",__label__1
Swagman XC-2 Bike Rack: I bought this product and would NOT recommend it to anyone. The rubber tubs are sticky and you need to wear gloves and it leaves marks on your bikes. The red rubber protecter fell off the first time it was used. The lock that was recommedned to go with it does not fit. When the tubes are locked in place you need a hammer to get them to release. The tire holder rails will not lock in place even with a pliers. I used the product as instructed in the manual and my bike fell off in the middle of an intersection! If you use this product than you need to bungi your bike in three places to secure it! Do Not just use the hooks!,__label__1
"Great Bike Rack: Bought this rack on Monday and it got here on Tuesday. Took about 30-45 minutes to put it all together. Once I figured out that I had to take some parts apart to put them back together on the rack base, it all went well. I love how the bikes mount and feel that the bikes are more secure than on the type of racks that the bikes hang from the top tube. I would defiantly recommend this bike rack.",__label__2
"great carrier for distances: We just finished with a trip to visit family and it worked great. Around 500 miles each way.It took about an hour to get it adjusted so I could get all 4 bikes on at once. After that, everything was set and I loaded 4 bikes in 10-15 minutes. I'm sure I'll get even better.The only improvement they could make would be to have two posts with more space. The middle 2 bikes fit really tight so you have to put them in just right. It was harder because my son has a BMX style bike and our daughter has a similar bike with 16"" (I believe) wheels. Those fall through the mounts, but it stays in there securely anyway.My arms don't lock in the down position very easily, but I only use that for storage so I'm not worried. I'd probably buy it again, especially for the price.",__label__2
Swagman Bike Rack: Very well made and solid (heavy). Not the sort of rack you would want to pull on and of your vehicle by yourself very often. If you want a rack where you don't worry about your bikes swinging in the breeze this is it. The rack does fold up so it doesn't stick out the back too badly when the bikes aren't on. The receiver pin tightens to take out the slop between the hitch and the rack.,__label__2
"Dance album of the year!: Wow! ...finally something new and creative for the dance floors this year. Got a promo of this album about a week ago and havn't stopped listening to it since. All of Mynt's hits in one place plus their new single ""Still Not Sorry"" which I think is really going to be a huge smash for them. Lot's of cool 80's production and fat synths on this one and I'd say it's definitely a worth while buy if u are into dance music/electrohouse 80's style./DJ Eric",__label__2
"as silly as the cover: I liked the first single ""How Did You Know"", so I decided to check it out.The songs and productions sound flat and unimaginative, nothing too new or exciting here.I cant remember even one of the songs.

"Yoga as Power: I am fortunate to be a student in Naader's yoga classes at Yoga Kingdom in Pasadena, CA. As someone who has studied yoga on and off for 25 years, i can confidently say that Naader's class is the most complete and well-rounded I have ever taken. For those in other parts of the world who would like access to an energizing, healing yoga workout, I would highly recommend this video.",__label__2
"Remains powerful even with repeated viewing: Naader was my first yoga teacher. When we moved out of state, this video was my link to the best yoga routine I have ever done. I tried other instructors and other videos, but Naader's approach is the best -- a balanced mix of yoga instruction and inspiration. I have shared this tape with many friends (who then bought their own copy!) and they all agree that Naader's instructions are easy to follow and the pace is slow enough that beginners can figure out what is going on before the next pose; but not so slow that experienced students get bored. Furthermore, since he is doing the poses along with the student, he knows just when to offer that extra word of encouragement when you are about to give up! I find something new to ponder each time I listen to this tape. Naader's words are from the heart and they reach out to touch your heart as well as your body. Buy this tape and use it!!",__label__2
disposable nipples: This is a great product overall. I was looking all over the place to buy these from stores but could not find it anywhere. My wife and I wanted to use these because the baby had used them while in the hospital and there is no washing or maintenance involved. However they are a bit pricey and the flow is fast relative to other nipples.,__label__2
Great Disposable Nipples: I used these in the hospital when my baby was born and they are great!Now I have them in my baby bag along with the formula bottles and I always have a clean nipple when we are out. I recommend them.,__label__2
"Best Disposable Nipples: I love these nipples. I've ordered so many of these because my son will only use this nipple. We have tried the Medela nipples and every other type imagineable that will fit on our Medela bottles, but this is the only one he would use. It's a slow flow which is perfect for him. We will be buying more before we head to Cancun so we can use with the Similac Ready to Feed bottles.",__label__2
"The absolute best!: I have a VERY picky 4 month old who refuses to eat using any kind of nipple other than these. These are what they started him on in the hospital and although they are supposed to be disposable, we have been able to use nothing else since (despite numerous purchases of other brands to try with him.)",__label__2

"Best Dirty Irish Cd ever ;): Harry Bradley, originally from Belfast, has mastered the ""dirty"" style of Irish flute playing, where the player plays with a pulsing breath that pushes the lower octave notes to get a very distinctive tone. If you listen to Irish Flute music, you don't need me to tell you who Harry Bradley is. If you've never heard Irish flute music before, this is a great cd to start with (every Irish flute player has or belongs to a distinctive style; you can try Matt Malloy and Kevin Crawford for others). Look also for Harry's flute duet cd with Michael Clarkson, ""The Pleasures of Hope""(great stuff) and his other album ""Bad Turns and Horseshoe Bends"" is also excellent. I think you can download an mp3 to see if you like it; I recommend ""Miss Thornton's/The Primrose Lasses"", the third track on the cd which is a great set of tunes that also demonstrate the Belfast/dirty style of playing.",__label__2

"A Wonderful Shared Experience About Living In A Different Culture: Bruce Feiler shares his experience as a new teacher in Japan and how he accommodates himself to the culture of Japan and its school system. The book includes many humorous episodes as well as studies in how to adapt to new surroundings and to people who have different behaviors from those of our own. The reader will develop a greater appreciation for the way in which the Japanese education system works at the levels described in the book and in how one must develop a thick skin and a great sense of humor in order to be accepted when traveling or working overseas. The characters in this book are real and are brought to life on paper quite effectively. This is a story of shock, adaptation, and, ultimately, but with a lot of hard work - success.",__label__2
"A waste of paper.: This book is one of many written during the ""Bubble Era"" by ""gaijin"" (primarily Americans) who really knew next to nothing about Japan, yet somehow found a publisher, usually Japanese. Another of this quickie genre published about the same time was a book for teaching profanity to Japanese studying English.""Learning to Bow"" may by an accurate account of the author's experience living in Japan and teaching in the JET program. However, that's all it is. It's full of cliches, sweeping generalizations, and offers no insight into living in Japan or understanding the culture. What could the writer possibly know after only two years?",__label__1
Upsetting: I may not a good reviewer because I stopped reading at page 50 but I believe this is not at all a good book to read if you want to learn about Japanese culture. As a Japanese born and raised in Japan I find this book extremely humiliating.,__label__1
"It would be misleading to say this is typical of a JET Programme experience: There is no one experience that could somehow describe them all. I didn't find the book very interesting, nor would I recommend it as reading for those who are going to go on the JET Programme sometime in the future. In fact, I recommend you read very little of the 'foreigner does Japan' genre and stick with facts, figures and Japanese language. And basics of English language teaching. Believe me, you will enjoy your 1-3 years in isolation and miscommunication without your head full of pop-anthropological nonsense and you will come to know your full self.",__label__1

"Outdated but insightful: The author's style is captivating and simple. He was in Japan over twenty years ago, so I'm assuming that some if not much of his anecdotes may be regarded as dated over there.

"Pretentious: ""I came to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Ministry of Education . . ."" indeed! Feiler has a very high opinion of himself. And isn't it a bit inappropriate for a teacher to kiss the hand of a junior high girl, let alone a junior high girl of another culture? I've been reading a lot of Japanese non-fiction and travel essays since a recent visit to Japan and so far this book ranks low in terms of enjoyment, educational value and insight because of its pretentious tone.",__label__1
"Worthy addition to the bookshelf: Stumbled across this recently and found it an agreeable and on-target accound of life in Japan, based on my own experience. Some parts soar, others drag, but one could say that about almost any biographical work that rings true. I've found one other memoir that more thoroughly nails shut the whole (surprisingly huge) ""teaching in Japan from the male perspective"" genre, but Feiler's book fills in a lot of blanks for those who wonder what it's like to live and teach in Japan, and does it in an engaging manner.",__label__2
"Sarcasm and fabrications: I was very disappointed in this book. I have lived in Japan for 6 years (and still do), married and taught on the JET Programme. As a former JET I was disheartened as this book does not paint an accurate picture of life in Japan as a JET. Granted people's experiences differ from prefecture to prefecture and from school to school, but Learning to Bow's anecdotes and observations about Japan are far too extreme and at times border on lies. Also the frequent use of sarcasm and satire is not in anyway humorous and portrays the author as ""god's gift to English teaching"". For anyone curious about life on the JET Programme, teaching English in Japan or life in Japan in general, I do not recommend this book.",__label__1
"An investigation into the nature of relationships: Why do we commit to one another? Do we really know? Would a life of independence and detachment be better? Both analytical and powerfully moving, this movie deals with these questions. At first seeming light and slightly intellectual, the movie evolves into something more felt than thought. The film shows what is going on without telling the viewer in words. This is a story about the nature of love in all its human forms. It is a heavy story that stays with you. Not for those not in touch with their inner self or who object to some tasteful nudity.",__label__2
"The unbearable lightness of being: This is already my favorite movie for at least ten years, from the first time I saw it. It is a movie about an unsettled men who lives life lightly, but is also in love. Slowly he is adapting to a life with only one woman, the one he loves. The very romantic and chalenging movie is set in Chechie around 1965 somewhere.",__label__1
"Highly overrated: It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up. How about some more nipples? Throw a pie in Juliet Binoche's face? Anything! Just stop wandering around, muttering to yourself like a half-wit.Perhaps I don't get it, but I don't get syphillis either and I'm the better for it. Where's your witty rejoinder to that?!A real test of patience, this film.",__label__1
"Constipated: I have no idea how I was talked into watching this movie. I totally believe this was a waste of good film-and a lot of it. A young Daniel Day Lewis with a hipper Fonz impersonation and a whiney Juliette Binoche. Only Lena Olin was worth watching, but not for any depth or anything. This film actually made a communist invasion dull. I absolutely didn't care for this couple. Below par acting, horrible direction, terrible editing, annoying soundtrack and dialogue so bad I think someone should take away the screenwriter's guild card. Don't waste your time on this one.",__label__1
"the ubearable pain to watch: This movie is the lamest peice of pseudo-intellectual crap I have ever seen. It is painfully self-serious and a major bore. This is porn for those who would never confess that they watch porn. If you want to see a good movie about human relations, go get ""Besieged"" by Bertolucci.",__label__1
"Take off your cloth: This movie is about nothing but nudity and sex scenes! In the first hour or so there is hardly any dialogue... just a nude scene after another. The only main dailogue is ""Take off your cloth."" And personally I don't consider this as a dialogue either.I didn't see the love story in this movie... no honest expressions. Just a man who lives a play boy life. I found this movie very boring and I even had to forward many of the sex scenes that I couldn't stand any further!Maybe if this movie had a dialogue, it would have made sense! Maybe if it was shorter! Maybe if there was less sex scenese! Maybe if there was a better (senseful) ending..!",__label__1
"Is This A Movie?: I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)",__label__1
"High class, well made, cinematic masterpiece!: I could go on and on about the various aspects of quality in this film...I will leave that for other reviewer's of this film. I would just like to add it is a beautiful masterpiece, complete in every way. An experience of old cold war Czechoslovakian lovers...there is tension, sadness, love scenes of high taste and quality throughout the film. Even a special few minutes when every woman watching the sequence on screen, would probably be a lesbian for the day. Its not about sex...its all about living a full life and loving someone deeply...buy this film and sit back and enjoy it...bring a handkerchief along for the ending.",__label__2

"One Great Big Sleeper: I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye.",__label__1
"Either you get or you don't..I didn't.: This is written by a 43 year old male who is a true film fanatic. I love all the great directors- Spielberg, Hitchcock, Wilder, Kubrick, Landis, Scorsese, etc. etc.""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" was one, if not the most tedious films, I have ever had to endure. Why is it so talked about is beyond me unless, there is nothing definable to discuss. The scenery was bland, dialogue uninteresting and unengaging, even the shots were dull.It's the first film I ever returned to Amazon...ever.When I took Cinema History in College, the Professors I had kept talking about this film as a ""must see/ will change your life"" sort of thing. Curious, as we never saw it in class (must have been the explicit erotic nature it has at times). Now I think they wanted the girls in the class to see it on their own, because they may have wanted to discuss it with them personally after the class was dismissed, if you catch my drift.I would pass on this one-big time.",__label__1
"The Unbelieveable Genius of Philip Kaufman: A glorious acheivment in the history of American Film. Passionately directed and gorgeously photographed, with impeccable acting from Day-Lewis, Binoche and Olin. ""Unbearable"" will linger in your head for weeks after watching it. And it's one of the few movies to use animal death in a non-cheap fashion: The death of Tomas and Tereza's dog is riveting and beautifully performed. Contrary to some opinions, the book is not better than the film; it's an entirely different entity structured in a seemingly unfilmable, non-linear fashion. As a written story, it doesn't make the kind of dramatic sense it does on screen. What Kaufman pulls off with ""Unbearable"" is truly remarkable.",__label__2
"Unique: Abstracting to connect: I've seen nothing like it. The supreme and rich acting of Binoche and the abstract cinematography and direction manage to distance the viewers in such a way from the everyday noise of a thousand feelings, enabling the viewers to taste and sense all the emotion and ideas of the characters and the era with a vividness only accesible in dreams.",__label__2
"Read the book - it takes less time!: The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style. For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy. For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character. OK, what is one to do? That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie. This is a SLOW film. It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it. I can't recommend the film.",__label__1
"Kundera was right to object: The movie doesn't at all reflect the original book story in its core concept. If I didn't read the book before I wouldn't be able to guess what is the movie trying to explain. I doubt anybody, based on the movie only, would be able to understand what happend in 1968 in the Czech republic and what was the consequence for the entire society.",__label__1
"Length makes the ""lightness"" feel heavy: Based faithfully on the book by Milan Kundera, a non-political Lothario doctor in Prague in 1968 comes to grips with two things in his life: his love for one woman and a commitment to the political uprising in his homeland. Because of the latter he is no longer allowed to practice medicine and is forced to live on a farm in poverty. His love for the woman, too, has been put to the test, yet he sticks with her, even though it means returning to his country after being given exile in France.The themes are intelligent and interesting, but the development is too slow: the movie is much too long at nearly 3 hours. Scenes seemed to be dragged out interminably, especially those in Paris as he weighs his conscience regarding his love and his homeland, and near the end on the farm. Because of this the movie as a whole seems to lack focus. But this is compensated for in the story's interest. The sex scenes are very sensual. Worth a watch.",__label__2
"The best film nobody saw: The Unbearable Lightness of Being is a masterpiece, the most underrated American film of the past 30 years. Poetic, haunting, subtle, and terribly sad, it says more about the crushing impact of repressive (i.e. communist) regimes than a thousand documanteries or inflammatory speeches could tell. While idealizing the free-wheeling Prague of the late 60's the film also examines the emptiness of such a non-commital lifestyle- the unbearable lightness. If this all sounds very somber, ULOB is also one of the sexiest films you will ever see, and one of the few intelligent studies of sex in cinema. More surprisingly, it is a heartbreaking romance. Like a great novel, ULOB grows on you, and you'll hate to see the characters leave you at the end. Perfectly acted by its then unknown leads, and beautifully photographed, this is a film to grow old with.",__label__2
"A wispy shadow of Kundera's book...: Making my comparison to Milan Kundera's book, I have to rate this movie fairly low. I don't believe Kaufman was able to capture the essence of Kundera's writing with this film representation. So much of Kundera's writing is internal to the characters, which is difficult (at best) to communicate on screen. Unfortunately, this is the richest part of the experience; I recommend the book, but found the movie decidedly unsatisfying.",__label__1
"The Unbearable Lightness of Being Boring: This is well acted, beautifully filmed...and pretentious exitentialist tripe. There's a difference between TRYING to be deep and serious, and being deep and serious. This movie doesn't know the difference. Long and slow.",__label__1
"Threesome with tanks: Supposed being victimized by local communist regime and Soviet oppressors since August-1968, a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at hospitals.No wonder, sex is a fix for such a lucky, and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with Southern European rather than Slavic appearance a little.Extended up to 165 minutes of screening, romantic tale with some near-porno inclusions is a bit more over-positive and over-entertaining than its final collapsed in.Well, movie spirit seems being similar to ""A Beautiful Life"", ""Producers"" or, more recent one of Levi's Hitler-as-a-comedy-hero, of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only.",__label__2
"So If I'm A Jerk Do I Get To Live In Perpetuity, Too?: Okay, folks. Let's get real. This movie/book is essentially about the insipid sexuality of three spoiled brats with soulful eyes, zero body fat, and no moral compasses. Worst of all, there's no search for the compasses. Why is this exhibition of unbridled existential selfishness so popular? Because the protagonists are European-and ""misunderstood"" quasi-intellectuals to boot. Translation: culturally paranoid Yanks just eat this kind of lean cuisine right up. If you're the type who likes being hungry 15 minutes after eating, don't miss this movie or ""The Sheltering Sky,"" mind-numbing fare featuring filthy rich American ""seekers"" ransacking the blistering desert (or desert tray) for spiritual bargains that won't make them too heavy with self knowledge.",__label__1
"Extremely Let Down: While a big Hendrix fan, as well as a fan of bluegrass - I was NOT impressed with this album. While the ""bluegrass"" was acceptable, it was a big stretch to extract the ""hendrix"" from what I was hearing.

What a stink: I used this cutting board in my sewing class and loved it. No odor at all from the one in class.I got my mat and it smelled as though I had hit a skunk. My husband made me put it on the back porch. Then I learned that a friend of mine had one for 8 months and hers still stinks. Her husband won't let her use it inside. I went online and read that others had found the same odor problem from these Olfa mats. Some said that the smell diminished after a few weeks but others said it has never stopped stinking.I e-mailed the Olfa distributor to ask if the company has other suggestions. I may just have to send it back.Great cutting mat if you don't mind a strong toxic smell.,__label__1

"Repeated book material & out of place reviews: Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)",__label__1
"Wow: Although Poul Anderson is not a typically a particularly bad writer, most of the prose in his portion of the book ""Pele"" is so bad as to be laughable. ""Tyra had more and more enjoyed her voyage, until near the end."" and ""The last weekly dance of the trip became an especially gleeful occasion."" I didn't even have to look very hard to come up with these gems. ""Memory stabbed her again."" Ha!It's almost as if it English was the author's second language.If you like authors that torture the English language you'll love this book.",__label__1
"Man Kzin IX: After a long hiatus from the Man-Kzin wars, I purchased the Man-Kzin Wars IX. The stories in M-K Wars IX were average at best. Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors.",__label__1

"Proceed with caution: This book is a continuation of Shore Lights, and follows the same characters as they now prepare for the wedding of Maddy DiFalco and Aiden O'Malley. I'm not sure why this book was necessary, because it didn't further the relationship, didn't end with the wedding, and was filled with family squabbles and bickering. I 'think' Bretton is setting us up for a story about Claire and her own love life, but I don't think it'd be very interesting based upon her character in this book. The story contained a lot of in-fighting between family members, lots of bad blood between relations and future relations, and turned a great character (Kelly O'Malley) into a bad one for the sake of the storyline. Actually, the story was quite dependant upon Kelly and her life to propel the action. I wouldn't recommend this book - it's a family drama with no romance. No romance, no sincere story, and a lot of drivel.",__label__1

After wasting your time with worthless and mediocre family stories and the well known government incompetence, you end up with the empty conclusion that a good pilot, in good health, all current and confident ditched in the stormy ocean at night and disappeared. None of the worthless stories or ILS text in this book provides any conclusion or lesson to be learned. A line from Billy Madison comes to mind: ""you are now all dumber after hearing this story"". In fact the only intelligent thought comes from an opinion of a reader that raises the theory that Ron S. used a GPS approach rather than ILS and that proved fatal.",__label__1

"helps in understanding children: For a long time I have been discouraged in my efforts to establish two-way communication with children. I would bring books, toys, and games to social functions and share them with children. Once one activity was over, the children would stare at me, waiting for me to start another activity.

"who's the archeologist?: The book makes a great read, same as DHC's other books of the ""Lost Cities"" series. Very entertaining, thought provoking, and well written. One thing though: I don't get why the author keeps calling himself ""a rogue archeologist"": someone has to explain to him what archeologists do. DHC is no archeologist, whatever he might think; he's a traveler, a gossip gatherer, and a free spirit, but all this has little to do with archeology. I enjoyed his open-mindedness, and the relativism with which he judges most of the theories and hypotheses considered. Going through his whole opus, I can't help noticing that this writer is a really great guy, and that his travel companions and friends must have been lucky to have met him, but archeologist? Please, give me a break. And use some proofreader, for the next edition.",__label__2
"Interesting book, a little more detail would be nice.: This book did give the reader some very interesting facts and folk lore about archaeological discoveries that could prove the existence of superior ""giant"" races in the Americas. The only thing I did not like about the book (except for the grammatical errors), was that the author would mention some dramatic event (such as the discovery of giants' bones in a mound) and leave the reader hanging after a couple of paragraphs about the find. This book could have easily been an entire set of volumes, should everything have been explained in detail. Overall, it was a very interesting book leaving the reader wanting to know more about certain discoveries and theories within the book.",__label__2

"Buddhist Enlightenment: On the peaks of the High Siera, Kerouac's narrator, Japhy Ryder explores the inner nuances of one's thought processes and being, away from the hustle and bustle of the Bay area's consternative environs. Changing thinking along with the weather and seasons, Japhy attends his attention to everyone ounce of his being, becomming one and all with his environment. Achieving moments of Zen purity, Kerouac is able to pinpoint the bountiful beauty and vitality of mother nature and of one's relation to it. A great read showing the inner exploration and sanctity with which Kerouac grounded his Bohemian lifestyle.",__label__2
"one of kerouac's finest: I've heard it said that this is Kerouac's greatest novel. I still say that honor is held by On the Road, but this book is just as good. And it is his most spiritual novel. Kerouac combines his talent at writing with his philosophy of life and what you have is a powerful tool to enlightenment. This book should be read on at least two levels, as a work of great literature and as a theological tool. I can't recommend it enough.",__label__2

The have very few possessions which they kepe is small shacks or in backpacks, and spend their time discovering nature and the dharma in this world.Kerouac's writing style varies - in certain parts it seems like pure fiction (describes parties, characters' interactions with family, etc.), at some points it seems very philisophical (i learned a bunch about Buddhism), and at some points it is just very descriptive (i live in NYC, and it made me miss nature.)There were a few parts that were ""wordy,"" but overall this book reads quickly and is very enjoyable.",__label__2

Better yet, instead of buying it, go to the local library to read it. Unless the people I described in my second paragraph have taken over and there are only Approved Books in the library...if there are libraries at all. Libraries cost money, and that means (shudder) taxes.For everyone else: this is Kerouak's best work.",__label__2
"Well...: I've read ""On The Road"" three times over the last six years. It is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. Having said that I decided to get ""Dharma Bums"" and I did not care for most of the book as I am not into Buddha and zen. Only once in a while a glimmer of the fun of ""On The Road"" seeped in, but not enough.I also did not like the supporting characters as I did in ""On The Road.""This book was pushed by many people as Kerouac's second best. I found it to be uninteresting and probably should not pursue any other of his books if this was considered ""his second best.""",__label__1

It contains the same exciting beauty, applied to different subjects,and the same eccentric freedom fighters as lead characters. Every once in a while it attains the perfect harmony it seeks, turning long stretches with no apparent action into meditations on the beauty of nothingness, of loneliness, etc. We see the budding alcoholism of our narrator, which wil turn into a book ('Big Sur') of its own. We see what Kerouac saw in Buddhism, and we'll see converts in the book's readers. Kerouac has perhaps more real-life affect on his readers than any other American novelist, one of the few writers anywhere who really can change lives. Blah.",__label__2

VIVA RUCKSACK REVOLUCION!: Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks.

On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better.,__label__2
"This is Kerouac's real masterpiece!!: I didn't much care for ""On The Road"" after the first 50 pages or so and i'd pretty much thought that this great ""Beat Writer"" was nothing but hype, but after reading ""The Dharma Bums"" I now believe Kerouac is one of the greatest writers of modern times.

Contemplating their religions and beliefs and coming to beautiful realisations about the world (""You can't fall off a mountain""), they create the rucksack revolution. A beautiful insight into thought and poetry. A must for anyone who wants to learn to think or expand their mind.",__label__2
"I'm gonna get blasted for this, but...: ... I just couldn't get into this book. It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels. From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with ""sez I.""",__label__1

"The Kindle version costs more than the paperback: As of this review, the Kindle edition cost $12.99 and the paperback cost $10.88 - or over $2 more expensive for a digital version that actually saves the publisher money. I actually enjoy Dharma Bums, but Penguin should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for this. I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat. I'll be sure to keep this in mind for future purchases.Also, for those who will bash my review, the cost of the book is an essential to the value proposition of a book. There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs??? You've got to be joking!",__label__1

"Kerouac is not that great: Maybe I am not as enlightened as all of you, but I don't think this book is all that great. Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing.",__label__1
"Failed to be powerful...or even interesting: One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes. (Is a person a real Buddhist if he is proud of his Buddhism?)What was a powerful and introspective journey for Kerouac, is not for the reader. I can tell that it's there, but Kerouac just doesn't get it all the way across. I found myself rolling my eyes, but still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.If this will be your first Kerouac read, as it was for me, choose something else or it may forever turn you off to Kerouac, who could be an otherwise fabulous story-teller.If he is, let me know.",__label__1
"Shallow: I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better.",__label__1
"Conceited book: Had to offset the praise handed down by so many people for Karourac's writings. Very overrated as a writer. This book is filled with the resemblance of substance, but has nothing in it. It is a contradiction of itself.",__label__1
"One show about nothing is enough: OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac.",__label__1
"Bummer: Not much dharma going on here. But lots of bum. In fact, I'm totally bummed out finishing this novel because now I feel very uncool to not be enamoured with this bible of the beat generation but I, just, don't, get, it. So much rambling! Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing. Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it.",__label__1
"I wanted to say ""Damn!"": ...but I had to expound on that on account of all these bad reviews.If this book is not for you to get then that's fine and it's sad, but don't be so angry--coherence isn't everything. It's the heart that makes Kerouac, the sailing, pounding, beautiful, soulful, angry, churning, palpable heart.And for those who worry that this is required scene material, the beat poets are dead, let them be. Read for yourself and its own rewards. That should be obvious; now go, enjoy this epic soul journey.",__label__2
"Excellent follow-up to ""On the Road"": ""The Dharma Bums"" is an excellent follow-up to Jack Kerouac's famous second novel, ""On the Road,"" a must-read for all Kerouac fans. Pay special attention to the infamous mountain climb by Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and John Montgomery--lots of great imagery, language, and central themes of life there. This book changed my life forever. It also contains the famous poetry reading (where Allen Ginsberg read ""Howl"") at 6 Gallery in San Francisco (Oct. 7, 1955).",__label__2

"Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it!: Yes, ""On The Road"" gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. ""Dharma Bums"" soars as high as ""Big Sur"" dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors.",__label__2

"A must-have for any theological library: This is THE definitive book on Reformed Presbyterian theology. Hodge is strong not only in what he explains, but also how he explains it. Each section is divided into questions, as if someone was interviewing Hodge. He then answers each question in a very logical, ordered manner, giving the reader a very clear perception of each particular concept. Hodge leaves nothing uncovered, but rather touches on a very wide spectrum of Reformed theology, and every time his argument is succinct and backed with scripture. Everyone interested in theology, clergy or lay-person, should read this book to gain a deeper understanding of what the Reformed persuasion believes and why.",__label__2

Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the girl replacing Megan Fox is a much better actress. The action and set pieces, including an amazing chase scene on a freeway are incredible. The last hour set in a war-torn Chicago are some of the greatest sequences ever put to film. Shia does a terrific job being both witty and funny, but also very emotional when the time comes. Unlike the first two Transformer movies, this time it truly feels like something is at stake.

sucks: i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie,__label__1
"kind of a pathetic dvd: I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one",__label__1
"Great Movie: Purchased this dvd as a gift. It arrived well within the alloted time and was well packaged. Another good buy through Amazon, my place to shop! EP",__label__2
"Great movie can't wait for the Blu ray: I have seen this movie 2 times in theaters. Optimus Prime turns bad ass in this one when he says ""We will kill them all"". The wreckers are great as well as Sideswipe and Mirage. I strongly recommend.",__label__2
"I feel as if I got scammed by Paramount: Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)",__label__1
"Transformers: This was an okay movie. You must enjoy the Bay Transformers Universe in order to enjoy this film. Oh yeah, and big explosions.",__label__2
Transformer: Items waas as described and shipped on time. Was a gift and just what was asked for. Item was in very good condition.,__label__2
"Transformers: This movie is a simply an action movie. It has the explosions, the cars, and the drama of an action movie and not much else. But then again, how much more do you need for a entertaining movie? With the level of graphics, a blu-ray is especially nice.",__label__2
"Awesome movie: If you seen the first two you will definately find this one the best! We first seen it in 3D at the movies and knew how good it was. By far go get this movie. My youngest son is a Transformers freak, and we've seen this about 1,000 times since we bought it! Awesome Film!",__label__2
"Uggh, such a waste of potential!: I really liked the first one, and the second one was okay too. But Dark of the Moon was difficult to sit through for me. Endless dialogue with minimal action sequences, I found myself looking at the time far too often. They dropped Meghan Fox, who despite her controversial reputation, definitely added to the cast. The special effects are still amazing, but there just wasn't enough action. BORING!!! If they are going to continue with this franchise they had better turn it up a few notches.",__label__1
It was like awesome: Most definitely a wonderful buy and beats the big box store price. The movie was awesome and I can't say enough about the whole experiece.,__label__2
"plenty of action and humor: consistent production quality like first two movies in the series..and like the other series movies,plenty of humor from the additional characters ( and first-rate actors) thruout the movie",__label__2
"action: Great action movie, intense, demographics was awesome. Definitely a but movie to watch again, but with prime time i can without buying it!!",__label__2
Good movie: I like all of the transformers movies. This one is fun too. I would recommend it to any fan of the first two movies.,__label__2
"AVOID at all costs!!!: If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release.",__label__1
"DONT DOUBLE DIP!! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERSION: This version is being rushed out at the end of this month. Michael Bay has stated that a Bigger and Better 3D bluray version will be released later, with ALOT more extras than this edition. That version will be release on standard Blu as well, Looks like before the end of this year, just in time for the holidays.",__label__1
Love Them All... But this is the best: I love all of the Transformer movies but I think this is the best one. Really well done. The only complaint is the absence of Megan Fox as the girlfriend. I mean how do you dump a guy you have saved the world with twice???,__label__2
"Michael Bay should be barred from making more movies.: This film was by far, the most mediocre, melodramatic, hackneyed, and banal piece of work that Bay has ever put on screen.If you have the mentality of a ten-year-old, then yes, you'll find this film entertaining, but for all adults out there, you should best skip this thing.",__label__1
Digital copy is expired: Digital copy expired 2 months ago so unable to put it on ipad. Would not have bought if i knew the digital copy wasnt included,__label__1
Great !!: So far the tablet has been really fun along with helpfull. I origanly got it so that my wife could access etc. That takes away the time we spend together. Our Fun is all the way of the house. Often I found it isolated. This smart thing has allowed us along with myself less restricted or confined to the back on wich it displays me. I have never even manipulated a befor. I always thought they were very limited and could not perform the average tasks. However I have been proven wrong. Surfing !!!!,__label__2
"Suck it Michael Bay: Boobies, explosions, and maybe the fight/transformation scenes would have been awesome with theater version basss/surround sound. A waste of time. Unless you're drunk. Then it's ok.",__label__1
"Even Amazon Prime can't Save Optimus Prime this time: Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this movie was. At least I didn't pay to see it and was able to read a software tech manual while ""watching"" this. The plot is thinner than the paper it was written on and the acting, well its typical Michael Bay which means you can see more believable productions at you local high school. It was easily an hour too long and the special effect have been used hundreds before. I think the saddest part was hearing Lenard Nimoy as Optimus Sentimental, I mean Sentinel. Gratuitous sci-fi pandering at it's lowest.",__label__1
"Be careful when searching for ""3-D movies"": I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones! I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections. Ouch. All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future. My bad.",__label__1
"unwatchable: The first few Transformers movies had awful dialog, bad acting, and substituted explosions for plot. And still I actually managed to sit all the way through them. I got about 45 minutes into this one and couldn't go on. Awful.",__label__1
Great movie: Who does not like all the transformer movies? Great special effects everytime. Worth buying and watching several times. Does not get ld watching.,__label__2
"Horrible: It isn't very often that I turn off a movie and walk away before it has ended but this movie was deserving of such behavior. Damn you Michael Bay for killing my childhood memories about Transformers. I believed that you were sincere when apologizing for the previous embarrassment that netted you a lot of money and wanted to believe that this movie would be better. No, it wasn't. Where is your pride? Better yet, where is your soul. Wait, I can see it circling the drain ready to disappear forever. I will never watch any of your movies again and hope the same for others. you. sick. bastard.",__label__1
"Dreadful: It's marginally better than the second of the series, with action sequences that border on coherent, but just a few minutes in it's already pointlessly foolish, and doesn't do much to redeem itself over the next few hours. Big robots, smash smash smash. Whatever.",__label__1
"Awful movie.: Standard Michael Bay garbage. Totally removed from the original idea, especially concerning Optimus Prime's character. The ideals the character originally stood for are completely ignored in favor of kill shots and 'Murican tough guy crap.",__label__1
"waste of time: continuity was not there, story line was unknown. so unrealistic, non continuous, special effect show that even that was no good.",__label__1
Enough already: Two of these movies was plenty. The hot girl was so ridiculously hot as to be unbelievable and not in a good way.,__label__1
"Unremarkable, but not as bad as the previous installment: I don't even remember the plot, the resolution, or much else about this. However, I also don't remember it being painfully bad as the previous installment was. You should not go out of your way to watch this, but there are worse movies.",__label__1
"WAAAY TOO MUCH CG!: I got dizzy watching the machines transform. I only watched the movie to see Chicago, because I live there. Needless to say, I did not like this movie.",__label__1
"One of the worst movies ever.: The acting is horrible. The story is nonexistent. This is a movie that is surely not worth your time.The special effects are its one redeeming factor, but they can't redeem this movie. The only good thing about this compared to Transformers 2 is that there is less screaming in this one.",__label__1
"Bleh: It takes more than special effects to make a movie. The first film was good, the 2nd one mostly decent, but this was unadulterated, predictable, garbage, full of bad acting eye candy. The heroine of this tale couldn't find a coherent sentence with a conjunctive map. Should have stuck with Megan Fox. At least she had some real attitude.",__label__1
"Unwatchably boring: ~40 minutes in, so bored I quit. Seriously, unintertained to the extent that I closed the browser. Honestly, though I've stopped watching a movie from lack of interest before, it's never been this bad. Also, the first forty minutes did not start up any comprehensible plot.",__label__1
Cant get narrator off !!!!!!!!! help !!! new dvd: I cant get the narrator off in the background.. I tried 3 different dvd players.. Anyone know how ? email me at gibby@sev.org.,__label__1
Transformers: I have not received it yet am very disappointed as I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting,__label__1
"A waste of special effects . . .: and a complete waste of electricity. Michael Bay has not been hungry for years, therein lies the problem. Let's see what happens in the inevitable sequel.",__label__1
"Avoid if you want ANY extra features.: First, I really enjoyed the movie. Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you. A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab. Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year. From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes. I haven't bought anything like this in quite some time.",__label__1
"Pathetic: Please find something else to do for two and half hours.There is are so many things wrong with this movie to list, but I will say there was one redeeming quality of the movie and that was actor John Malkovich.As I said I am not going to go into all the things that made this movie horrible, but I will say for just about two hours I was hoping it would end and every time I had enough, John did his thing and I was back to watching the movie.I had thought number two was bad but his one was even worse and lets hope that they never make another one.Timahh",__label__1
"Kiddie Fodder...: Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague.",__label__1
"best movie of the 3!!!: this was by far the best of the 3 movies. the human interaction is better and the robot battles are infinitely better. from the beginning of the movie to the end is non-stop action. this is one of the few movies i saw 2 times in the theater. once in the regular screen and once in imax 3D. it was money well spent. i would tell anyone who is thinking of buying it, to DEFINITELY buy it!",__label__2
Movie is horrible...: Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture.,__label__1
"No 3D Bluray in this release, no sale.: Double dip express continues and continues and continues......Thankfully we have Amazon reviews to keep a few buyers from losing out, much like the LOTR Blurays.Still as long as there are consumers to buy these initial skimmed down releases and the studio can make a profit the farce will carry on.",__label__1
"epic fail: very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed.",__label__1
"This film gave me brain damage: First of all, its boring. At the 30 minute mark I forgot what movie I was watching. And at two separate points in the film (I forget what points, in fact I seemed to lose all perspective on time) I literally went cross eyed. My right eye is still lingering in a lazy wobble at the moment. All I really do remember was rooting for Leonard Nimoy to destroy the planet and all the retarded humans that inhabit it.Things I learned from T3 - Michael Bay's film making talents could effectively be adapted into a new kind of non-surgical lobotomy procedure for mental patients. I think I dodged the bullet on permanent catatonia due to the fact that I spent half of the movie day dreaming about more exciting things in my life...like porn, and rearranging my sock drawer.",__label__1
"This movie is the definition of bad: Many of the reviews on here praise this movie for it's visual prowess. Personally I think that is like praising a brain dead super model. Yeah, it looks good and the action sequences are crazy. However, it has NO semblence of a plot. The movie as a whole is incoherent, disjointed, and just generally stupid. Nothing flows, and everything from the acting to the diologue is terrible. I don't know what the director was smoking when he inflicted this peice of shit on the world, but if you have half a brain you will find it as insufferable as I did. Don't waste your time.",__label__1
cool movie: i had never watched this movie and happened to start watching it with my company and found it to have great animation to it. would recommend to anyone.,__label__2
"SciFi Movie: Plenty of action and almost lives up to the others in the franchise. However, not to be missed or overlooked as one of the btter robot wars themed movies.",__label__2
Avoid.. Falsely advertised: Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon.,__label__1
"Terrible. Horrible. Awful movie.: Much too long, excruciatingly boring and all Shia LaBeouf does is scream for over 2 hours. I made the horrible mistake of actually BUYING this movie.",__label__1
"Dear Mr. Bay, Please stop ruining the Transformers franchise: I love to see the Transformers in movies but I will never get the time back that I spent watching this movie. Good actors in a crap movie do not make a good movie. Fantastic special effects do not make a good movie. A well written story and characters that you care about make a good movie.",__label__1
"Starts of with a bang but fades: I enjoyed the first Transformers immensely. It was quirky, fun and exciting. I'd heard Dark Side of the Moon had recaptured some of that magic. And at first it mostly did. But then, like so many big budget action movies it devolved into noise, machines smashing one another one frame after another, after another, after another... And at over 2.5 hours in length you reach a point where you stop caring. You could edit out a third of the content and it would have been a better movie.",__label__1
"Redefinition of LAME: I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The ""stars"" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!",__label__1
At least the special effects were fun: The special effects (and the fact that I am from Chicago) were the only things about this movie that I liked. The story was dumb and the acting SUCKED!! I can only recommend this for someone who has absolutely nothing else to do and doesn't mind sacrificing a couple of hours.,__label__1
fabuloso: mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando con ustedes,__label__2
"Waste of time: There are movies that make you wonder what's going on, but they do so on purpose. In this movie, I was confused from the start and obviously not on purpose. It has no actual plot just an excuse for more graphics. Where as 1st movie had some plot, the last 2 had none. Waste of time.",__label__1
"So bad: The previews of this movie were the best things about it! The female lead's obviously surgically altered lips were distracting and the idea of people slamming into buildings and sliding through broken glass uninjured was laughable. The transformers were awesome but how long can you watch those scenes before enough is enough. So bad,so disappointing so save your money!",__label__1
"This ... movie ... sucks: At least the other Transformers movies had Megan Fox for eye candy. Rosie-my-plastic-surgeon-went-berserk-with-the-silicone-and-that's-why-I-have-ginormous-lips-that-don't-move-Huntington-Whiteley is ugly. My eyes hurt from watching her and this movie. Rented this movie only out of morbid curiosity. There, that's all that needs to be said.",__label__1
Lousy: This movie became so boring I stopped watching it after an hour and a half. I liked the first one much better.,__label__1
"Geh: Blah blah, sexy girl, blah blah, fighting robots, blah blah, cliche action lines, blah blah, talking robots, blah blah blah.",__label__1
"Boring: Less of a plot than the first movies. Fell asleep twice watching it, despite all the explosions....Seems like the writers may be running out of ideas",__label__1
Weak: I enjoyed the 1st Transformers movie for what it was. Found the 2nd to be unwatchable. This one is better than the second one but what is that saying.,__label__1
"Try to see how long you have to watch before you realize this movie is a disaster...: It only took me about 15 minutes. These Transformers movies keep getting more expensive and equally more ridiculous. The first one was charming and really funny, especially the first half. The humor reminded me of Armageddon. I actually liked Shia LaBeouf back then. This one tries way too hard in every aspect and fails in almost all of them. I understand these movies are not to be taken too seriously (I mean this is one step up from Power Rangers), but this movie could've been presented much better.The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the special effects and action sequences were exciting at times.",__label__1
"awful: This movie was terrible. No plot, action was written by a 10 yr old Shia is beyond annoying and the actress who's name I'm not going to bother to look up can't act and wasn't much to look at either.",__label__1
"Boring and Stupid: Dark Side of the Moon makes the first Transformers movie look like Citizen Kane. I got about halfway through this movie before I had to stop watching. The plot was utterly nonsensical. I had no sympathy for any of the characters--the sooner Megatron kills Shia LeBoeuf the better--in my opinion. The action scenes were so convoluted, I couldn't even tell what was supposed to be happening nine times out of ten. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, Michael Bay, Don't make another Transformers Movie.",__label__1
"100% Satsified: The item arrived in perfect condition. The transaction was easy, convenient, and service was efficient. I've used this seller on other occasions and have never had a problem. I am completely satisfied and would highly recommend to others. In this case, I chose the seller because of good experience in the past, despite a slightly higher price-- and still a great bargain!",__label__2
"Transformers: Dark of the Moon: This is a disappointing film. The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects. This one didn't really bother. Mind numbing, and in a bad way.",__label__1
The best so far: Great popcorn flick. Big difference between the dvd & bluray. The digital copy has been great since we own an iPad,__label__2
Transformers: Love it but not as good as the other 2. Shia is great as always and love the soundtrack also but that is just me. Very good graphics but I was really paying more attention to the story and ya gotta just love it when dictator obama is spliced into a movie as the good leader that he isn't and they made George W. Bush look like an idiot. But this is hollywood and they suck.,__label__2
"Not more than meets the eye: 20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. I was disappointed by this movie I am actually embarrassed I bought it last Friday when it came out. My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys. The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever. No character development, no real emotion and Transformers that in many scenes never even fought back. If you have to rent it skip the first 45 minutes, but don't buy it it's just not worth it.",__label__1
Disappointing!: Just got this Blu Ray and just found out there is no DTS sound unlike what the description says on Amazon. Wait for the better version!,__label__1
"I Wish I Could Give Zero Stars: This is by far the worst of all the Transformer movies. Every scene with Shia and his blowup girlfriend is a slap in the face to modern women. After watching for thirty minutes, I realized I had wasted enough of my time and stopped the film. If I had paid for this, I would have thrown a temper tantrum until I got a full refund.",__label__1
A Time Waster: This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Poor Shia has to have a high paid model to make his acting look better.,__label__1
Not 3D: THis company advertised this as a 3D movie. When I received it it was only a Blu-ray. They told me I would have to ship it back to them to prove it. I was very upset and they are horribel to work with.,__label__1
"Painful 2 and a half hours: I wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but figured it would be a fun enough way to zone out for a while. Wow was it ever worse than I thought it could be! Full of ""clever"" one-liners, bad characters (both humans and robots... really? There's an old British autobot named ""Q"" who designs fancy gadgets and weapons?), and action that was at times fun, but for the most part incredibly drawn out and ultimately just boring. Basically this was 2.5 hours (and it feels like 4) of unpleasantly spent time.",__label__1
"Provincial: There's so much to say about what's dumb about this movie, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. A great movie when you want to give your brain a rest. Best viewed on mute.",__label__1
"Transformers: Well, I didn't think the series would get worse , but it did.This movie is not only bad , I wouldn't buy this on DVD, Blu Ray , or on bootleg.This is as bad as it gets for action movies . I will keep the first Transformers movie and forget about the others that followed.",__label__1
"I fell asleep.: I know it sounds hard to believe, this movie being so loud and ""spectacular,"" but I was just so bored by the giant gizmos shooting at each other again, I fell asleep.",__label__1
"A bunch of CGI crap.....: The girl who replaces Megan Fox wears white the ENTIRE MOVIE, it borderlines stupidity. The movie is just garbage, I'm not gonna waste your time telling you every bad detail, but it almost seems that several things were done just to piss Megan Fox off completely ignoring story line.",__label__1
"Hmmmmm.: I really enjoyed the first two live-action Transformers movie but this one ... no! I was definitely disappointed with the casting of Sam's new love interest. There was a lot of action but it seemed ""action for the sake of action."" I felt that the picture ""worked too hard at being good."" There were times I couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon. Some of the scenes were extremely crude and others tried my patience. So no Megatron, no Ironhide, and no Sentinel Prime. We have the one-armed Optimus and the unscaved Bumblebee. Agent Simmons was there being well ... he was there. Better luck next time, Bay.",__label__1
"Ugh!: The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss.",__label__1
"Bad movie? You're soaking in it: Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague.",__label__1
This movie doesnt deserve any stars...: Total mind rape of a movie. This was by far the greatest let down of 2011. I found this movie disrespectful to the true Transformer fans and see this regurgitation as a middle finger from Micheal Bay to all of us. If your a True Transformer fan stay away.,__label__1
"Disappointed: I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and was disappointed when I got it. It said online that it was a 2-disc and I only got one disc. It wasn't in it's original packaging, and I payed as much for it as I would in a store.",__label__1
"Ouch: In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes.",__label__1
"Amazon video streaming does not work: Tried Amazon's video streaming for the first time for Transformers via the TV, but sadly it did not work. We have watched many movies from Netflix so surprised when this did not work especially after paying $3.99. Looks like I need to go back to DVD rentals for new releases at the blockbuster kiosk.",__label__1
"Review on the movie: Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to read people going on and on about how horrible this movie was. I understand if you are a fan of the Transformers in the 80s that you might be upset, but I'm not and I liked this movie. You aren't supposed to over-analyze movies like this! Just watch the good graphics, attractive people, and be entertained! This franchise isn't something that is supposed to make you think. I mean really. Anyway, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. I think this was far better than the 2nd one, which was very lacking. The graphics are good and it's entertaining, especially if you have some time to kill and just want to turn your brain off and be entertained.",__label__2
Dark of the Moon DVD: Great value for money. I purchased this DVD for my son as he loves Transformers. Received the DVD before the estimated date and before it was due to be released in Australia.We were only interested in the movie(extras etc not a big deal for my son) so it was a very good buy.Quality of movie was good too.,__label__2
"From Gods to Machines: I received the message that the U. S. government is hiding knowledge about what is beyond Earth's atmosphere. But all governments hide information from the masses of their people. What intrigued me was when the Sentinel Prime character said to the Optimus Prime character that they used to be gods and now they were called machines. I can relate to that statement. I am a descendant of a people that were performing high sciences at one point in time and now we are beasts of burden. Try to talk to a typical African person about science and see what you get. At best they'll say, how does this help me pay my bills? At worse they'll look at you like you have 2 heads.",__label__2
best video ever!: THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE ANYONE WILL EVER SEE IN THEIR ENTIRE FREAKING LIFE! BEST MOVIE EVER! IT ROCKS!,__label__2
Dosen't play well: This DVD does not play well at all. I wish I would have purchased this elsewhere. The price for this should have been much less to equal the quality.,__label__1
"AMAZING: Just went to the premiere and holy crud is that movie legit. Tons of laughs, emotion and of course the best action special affects you'll ever see. Definitely go see it if you loved the first 2 or even liked. You'll be into this one the whole way through",__label__2
Really boring and very flat 3D: I've tried watching this movie twice now and have fallen asleep about half way through each time. The opening plot is really boring and the 3D is flat and uninteresting. Good 3D needs to have a few things flying out of the screen once in a while ... this doesn't. My friends tell me the ending is pretty good but I've never stayed conscious long enough to see it.My advise - get the new Resident Evil 3D instead - if you like stuff flying around this has it --- POW!Cheue,__label__1
"simply stupid: A waist of time, money, and brain cells. Do not waist your time with this pointless drivel. This makes me hope they never make another attempt at a Transformers movie.",__label__1
"Yes, but no cigar: Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Make no mistakes, is a good movie if you like machines beating up humans without the humans being make into jelly.The opening was the best in the world. If they had only kept it that way... But no. It desintegrated into pieces. The FXs were fabulous, but you can't make a whole movie out of that.Sorry fans. I was disappointed, but then I'm not a kid anymore, so that's probably the reason.",__label__1
"Super...cynical!: Paramount has soared to new heights of ""vulture-ness,"" patiently sitting on a branch for the last sap to buy this on Blu-ray before conveniently swooping in on said saps with the 3-D release. (Can't remember if Thor hit theaters as a 3-D movie, but I think it did, and Paramount is using the same release strategy there.) Please resist this strategy fellow would-be saps. The movie is a solid 3 (couple of weak plot lines)...the release strategy gets it rated a weak 1!!",__label__1
"Poorly Made DVD: I'm glad I rented this one first, because image quality was horrible. I popped the disc in my PC to take a look, and discovered the movie was only 2.8GB. What was Paramount thinking? A DVD can hold 8+ GB. The more space that's used, the higher the bitrate. A low bitrate results in poor image quality. So, what we get is a DVD that's nearly empty, and a highly compressed mess of a movie. Thanks for nothing, Hollywood.",__label__1
"Pre-Order Screw Up: This review does not reflect anything about the movie. I pre-ordered this item Sept 22,2011 thinking I was going to get it as soon as it was released. Guess what? It's Oct 3rd and and I'm still waiting. Will update review as soon as get the movie. Update: Finally arrived 4:30pm Oct, 3rd.",__label__1
"I saw this movie in 3-D: I really don't think I would buy the blu ray dvd movie, but when I saw it at an IMAC theater in 3-D, it was increadable. That's the only way to see this movie. Without the 3-D effects, it's not that great.",__label__1
"Following in Peter Jackson's foot prints?: This pisses me off,what a burn! I knew this came out in theaters in 3D. You find in the case a coupon for the 3D version coming out ""Soon!"" Bite me Paramount. I'm taking this back for my money. Keep the coupon. What am I suppose to do with this combo after I buy the next? You and Peter Jackson must share the same marketing people.",__label__1
GOOD PURCHASE!: I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!,__label__2
"It's ""OK"" but not as good as the first two.: Bought it because it was part of the series and I really enjoy Shai LeBouf as an actor. Really liked him in Disturbia and in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (although the plot of that movie was pretty lame. but that's for another review.) Disappointed with how they explained the absence of his true love, Mikeala, and why they broke up. For him to have a model as a girlfriend seemed a bit of a reach. She lacked the toughness that spurred the character of Sam (Shai) to do great things. This movie is on a scale of 1-10 about a 4 for story line and a 7 for action. I still bought it but am kinda disappointed.",__label__2
awesome movie: This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this TV series.,__label__2
transformers: really great movie packed with a lot of action keeps you off on the edge you don't get bored or tired of watch it always something happening,__label__2
"""Dark of the Moon""-What a blast!: First off, let me just say that I am a huge Michael Bay fan.From ""Bad Boys"" to ""The Island"",he has created some of the most exciting action sequences since the last decade,and ""Transformers 3"" is no different.I must admit that I did not like the first film-nor cared too much for the abysmal sequel that was ""Revenge of the Fallen"",but Bay finally got everything right for this installment.And the last 40 or so minutes is definitely worth multiple viewings.(The toppling building sequence impressed me tremendously),and the cast stays on point to where there are no weak links.Some credit has to be given to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam Witwicky's(Shia LaBeouf)girlfriend,who is actually alot more tolerable than Megan Fox.Long story short,I wish I had gone to go see this one,as it proves that Michael Bay is still fully capable at keeping our attention with off the wall action spectacles.Keep up the good work.",__label__2
Transformer: Very please with the product and time to receive the merchandise..Will definitely buy from Amazon in the future. Very pleased with the purchase.,__label__2
"Expectacular Movie: The Movie is expectacular, amazingly directed and the visuals are well crafted, the visuals are very realistic, and a well budgeted film in 2011. Absolutely a collectors item.",__label__2
"Not bad, not the best: I am a HUGE fan of the Transformers movies, but I have to say that this is not the best of the series. As much as I am not a Megan Fox fan, they should have kept her. I also thought that the ending was a bit abrupt. Not really the way I would have ended the series. (to my knowledge, it was the last)",__label__2
optimal purchase: great to film in 3D optimal image ferso recommend to anyone who likes the film still in HD. . . .,__label__2
great movie: This is a great movie lots of action and intrege. Being the third movie in the series i was afraid it was gonna be a flop but it was a great movie after all.,__label__2
"AMAZZZZIIIING QUALITY!!: This is the reason for HD TV's to exist, to watch a movie like this with higher quality and sound that a theater. Just great, buy it if you are a fan, buy it if you love movies, buy it if you love HD, buy it if you have a TV and a couple of hours to enjoy a good action movie.",__label__2
"The graphics were good, that's about it.: I am not a professional movie critic, but I love movies. This was a poorly written movie and that's why I gave it two stars. The focus for this movie was clearly to make money utilizing graphics and taking advantage of a strong fan base. After watching it, I understand why Megan Fox turned down the opportunity to be in it. I would give you examples from the movies as to why it was so horrible, but let's just say it was that forgettable.",__label__1
Solid popcorn flick: Ignore all the haters. It's still giant robots from space fighting each other. Enough said. On par with the first movie and better than the second one.,__label__2
"Love the transformers series: Great movie series, fun to watch hope it continues with more sequels. This one was as good as the first ones.",__label__2
Dark of the Moon: I love this movie! The special effects are crazy and the storyline was interesting also. I highly recommend this movie.,__label__2
"3D Rocks: This video is incredible in 3D. It was a gift for a relative and he absolutely loves it. Viewed on a 3D TV and 3D BluRay player, it was just like going to a movie on the big screen.",__label__2
Great movie: Thanks for the great price and movie. It was really good. But of course I love the 1st one the best.,__label__2
"Not a good movie at all...stinks!!!: Well the critics got this one right; Michael Bay was a good director until he got big and lost his perspective. Dirty old man syndrome? Yes, what a joke. I was looking forward to intelligent Sci-Fi and got crap. The reference to Obama in an unreal world was stupid (I came to get away from real world politics). The treatment of the woman in the movie was degrading (glad the other actress bowed out...what a tear down}. It was a shame that the very good actors that came back to do this film had to deal with a totally self-involved director. The animation was excellent but the story was trash. I am soo sorry I spent any money on this film.",__label__1
"Nice show but wait for the 3D version: Wait for Black Friday or the 3D version to be released,it gonna be like LOTR Bluray all over again.First version Theatrical version(normal length)Second Version Extended Cut",__label__1
"Same as Avatar - No 3D or special feets!!!!!!! Booooo!: Booooo!Don't buy it because no special features are available but there will by by years end, so another clever studio scheme capitolizing on consumers! Yes, they probably factored per 1 million copies sold - 10 - 60 % will double dip generating a flow revenue for the impatient and believe me 90% of americans are IMPATIENT, so they know they have the rabbit by it's tail! Don't take the blue or red pill on this one!!! No rabbit holes running deep here, just peoples pockets that are succorred into buying the bare-boned Optimus...I hope this truly helps you out, seriously..",__label__1
"The joke's on me, I watched this crap! Coming from a diehard TF fan!: I can't believe Hasbro alowed Micheal Bay to butcher this franchise on the big screen! Okay the first one was okay, the second one was pure imature garbage, and Dark of the Moon was meh.... I will say though there are some G1 nods, but not enough, for crying out loud they did a horrible job on Soundwave, and Shockwave, and why did they make Bumblebee such a crazy warrior, for goodness sakes in the G1 series he was a Recon Transformer, not a fighter, because he would always get he's butt kicked! And Starscream getting killed by Sam, really Bay? And of course the human are flat out stupid, crude, cartoonie, and just add to stupidity of the trilogy! And Megatron is crap in this, they make him look like a sad lost puppy in ROTF, and DOTM, and Alpha Trion (excuse me SENTINEL PRIME) was never on the Ark! And Alpha Trion was never a Prime! They should rename this trilogy, BayFormers!",__label__1
"It's time for human slaves to meet their masters!!!: And these masters are Michael Bay and his computers!!!And we have no one but ourselves to blame!!!This movie is like a 2.5 hours car crash. When you think it can't get any worse - it does.It would deserve 2 stars if it didn't have any human actors. But Michael Bay is actually controlled by his computers, and they made him put these humans in this movie to make us suffer even more!!!This is all I have to say. Transformers IV is coming soon to the theaters near you. Preorder your tickets now!!!",__label__1
"Held my interest for minutes at a time: Some really nice animation and some segments that held my interest for minutes at a time, but mostly disjointed and tiresome. The talented cast improves the quality of the film, but not a lot.",__label__1
"Just watch the first 10 minutes the rest is drying paint: 2 big complaints:1. great start with the archive video of the moon race, including references to NASA, Sputnik, and the Soviet moon probes. No story to follow.2. Dumb girl, ""eek!"" Really beautiful, but never physically confronts these huge machines. Hey, the guys are just as unmatched as she. She is shown at the start at resourceful & smart. Give her something! Her only power was in gossiping to the bad bots to play mind games.One small complaint:The little boy in me would love to see the transformers build into some mega bot, like Power Rangers do, or to use some junk around them to add to their arsenal.",__label__1
"Simply Awful: Painful to watch. Hopefully, this will be the last Transformers feature, with future funding going towards far more worthwhile projects.",__label__1
"A 2 star movie at best & what a dog: I recorded this movie from freebie I got from dishNetwork and wow what a let down, Acting has really takening a nose drive on this one. Way to many actors in it many of them were flat out goofy and love interest has way to much collagen in her lips makes her look like she has a hockey puck in them and she came across as blond bimbo. Dialogs,talking was to fast and hard to follow way to much mumbling and confusion going on. Makes me glad I did not shell out some cash for see this dog. Hasbro should be ashamed to have their name link to it. Lastly hang on to your money you will find it at here or at some other Online store for less than price of a movie ticket.",__label__1
Great movie: Unfortunately I had to return this movie. It was also a Christmas gift. Already had one.. My kids have one or I would have kept it..,__label__2
"More of the same: The special effects are what you expect from the Transformers series, but the story line also is unfortunately what you expect. It's just more of the same disjumbled events getting thrown together. Some parts of the movie flow well, and others are just plain ridiculous. It's past time the writers & director for this series either move on or grow up and quit turning every scene into some kind of teenage behavioral prank. They've done the bumbling parents, the stuttering idiot Witwicky kid, the jive talking robots, and the goofball super secret ex-agent to death already. How about having grown adults who are fighting for the planet's survival actually act like it?",__label__1
"Don't buy this movie: I am glad I watched someone else's movie before I spent money on this lousy thing. I will always be on my do not buy list. Rose what's her name is not worth seeing in the movie. It would have been better without her all together. And she didn't hold a candle to Megan Fox. I did like the FIRST TWO movies but this one is a total waste. Boring from the word go other than some things about Kennedy and the early space program. It would have been better as a cartoon. If they come out with another one, I will not be spending any money on it. This one was so boring during the middle of it I about fell asleep.I would not waste the money on it, just borrow someone else's movie and save your money for a good movie.Oh and I might give it a 2.5/10 but since this is on a 5 scale it only gets a 1 and I would have given the other 2 movies a 4/5.",__label__1
"Laughable - Not for Kids: As usual in this series, the writing was a joke. The effects were spectacular, but I winced several times at the cheesy dialogue and woeful exposition. The animated move from the 80's is a much better story. I'd heard that this installment was much better than the first two, but I was just as dissapointed. I also thought we might have less women walking around looking like expensive call girls with Megan Fox's exit, but there was even more gratuitous butt and boob exposure than in the others. I should have known better than to waste my 4 dollars and 2 and a half hours. Don't let your kids watch this!",__label__1
Not a good movie. Not for children.: Not recommended for children and not even teenagers.Poor story.Nothing new or interesting.I was expecting something better.Dissapointed.,__label__1
movies on time: The movies get to me the same day they hit the stores and I dont have to drive to get them.,__label__2
"No Special Features: First, the movie has incredible special effects, but the script and acting are horrible. However, the real problem with this package is that the disc does not have any special features!",__label__1
"Horrible.: The weakest link of the Transformer trilogy; The first two were decent films, how did this one end up so bad? I barely made it through the theatrical viewing, I couldnt imagine buying it and watching it again.",__label__1
"Horrible film: Horrible film that should be avoided by all, exept maybe 10-14yr old boys. This film is actually worse than the second installation in the Transformers trilogy. I'm a fan of the first Transformers film & also the 1980's cartoon along with sci-fi films in general, but even for me & my easy-going taste in films, these two sequels are absolute pieces of rubbish.The Blu ray quality is fine though, crisp visuals with a strong TrueHD track, unlike the first film's release on Blu ray.",__label__1
Far too long and too formulaic: Oh please... this movie doesn't tell a story so much as show off special effects and replay platitudes. Should've left well-enough alnoe instead of making this far-too-long sequel.,__label__1
"Terrible movie with good special effects: The plot was terrible. The acting was terrible. The effects were as good as the other ones. If you want to see pure action without any story, then enjoy. Otherwise...it was a complete waste of time.",__label__1
"Science Fiction Pushed To The Limit!: I am only writing this spoiler-alert review because most people have already seen this movie:This time Michael Bay pushed science fiction beyond the limits of credibility, and that's where he lost me.I can see alien robots flying all over the place and destroying everything in their path, but THAT GIRL WITH THAT GUY WHO HAS NO JOB, AND NOT CHEATING ON HIM WITH HER ALPHA-MALE BILLIONAIRE BOSS? -ABSOLUTELY NO WAY!!!Now, to Michael Bay's credit: the acting and the special effects are incredible. Specially the scenes where she is riding in Sam's old deplorable car acting like it's no big deal for her. Those scenes do look real.",__label__1
Digital Copy Doesn't Work: Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed. Nothing on the Amazon site indicates the expiration date. The package has this warning on both the outside and inside. Amazon offered a full refund. That's a stand up company in my opinion.,__label__1
"Ok dvd/blu-ray but digital copy will NOT work. Codes are expired!: I specifically got this version of the movie for my husband so he could have the movie on his iphone. The code expired in September and they are still selling it to people as dvd+blu-ray+digital copy. But you cannot get the digital copy because of the expired code. If you wanted the file for itunes like we did, DO NOT BUY!!!",__label__1
The worst of the trilogy!: This was suppose to be such a great movie and it fell very short of all the expectations I had. I have been a huge fan of transformers since they came out in the early 80's. It's sad to think this could be the end of them on the big screen. I hope they redeem themselves by doing a 4th installment. Bring in Hot Rod and Ultra Magnus from the original series. I for one hope they don't end on such a poor film. I was very disappointed! As hard as that is to say. It was really bad.,__label__1
perfect: The whole transaction went smoothly. Arrived within reasonable amount of time however have not had the time to watch the movie yet!,__label__2
"Want Megan Fox back!!!!!!!: I liked and enjoyed the effects but that's about everything entertaining about this movie. The quality (blue ray on ps3) is pretty bad ass.Story line is very mediocre and no depth at all. The acting was sad at times.And most importantly I missed Megan Fox, someting just wasn't right with the new big upper lip girl. Maybe with Megan it would have been a better movie? Guess we will never know.",__label__1
"Terrible movie..: They need to get a new director and new script writer.. They just keep getting worse and worse.. Get rid of the Witwicky's.. It was funny the 1st time,now everything is just drawn out.. I never saw it in the theater and just bought it on blu ray.. I'm regretting it.. I don't understand why they don't use the original voice for Megatron.. I won't watch another one.. They should add the Dinobots,and make Devastater like in the cartoons,5 robots merged into a giant one,not a cross between a cement mixer and garbage compactor.. Cmon,what a shame.. It could be so great if someone actually cared about it.",__label__1
"a great movie: I really liked the movie and i really hope this is the Last Transformers movie.I am only giving it 5 stars for the movie and not the price.I think that is to much for just one dvd which is not a blue ray copy.This price should go down to at least $15.00yeah new movie but price for this nope.Transformers will be always cool, to me at least the three movies did come out good,I would wish they stop making movies from cartoons, Leave the cartoons alone.5 stars for the movie not the priceAlso in the movie, new actors, and new leading lady she was good,His parents had small parts which is good because in this movie they showed him more of a grown man.The scenes from the movies are cool, shot in Chicago and that is a cool city,Alos make you think of the cover ups that really did or did not happen on the moon, or why we went into space.So if you already have the other two movies get this third movie but try to find a lower price",__label__2
"What is the Region of this Bluray?: HI Everyone, I was looking into the specs of this Bluray and it doesn't say if it is a Multiregion Disc? In the European site it says... Multiregion.",__label__2
Not worth the 3 month wait: 3D is all about pop outs gimmicks which is all missing here there is depth but average not that great. The movie & audio both are great but everybody was anticipating one of the best 3d blurays which is not the case. There are many other movies like Resident evil Final destination 4 & 5 and many others which have awesome 3d effects. If you have already bought the 2d version do not regret.,__label__1
"garbage: Transformers the Movie (1985) was awesome. But these Transformers look like a pile of garbage throw together. The CGI animation makes everything look like synthetic barf. The Transformers movies need a reboot, where the characters actually look like they are supposed to. And without the worlds worst director Michael Bay. Disgusting. Don't let your kids watch this atrocity.",__label__1
"If you have already watched trasformer 1, don't spend your time to watch this, even it is free.: If you watch trasformer 1, don't spend your time to watch this, even it is free. I consider this movie is just below the episode 2 and the 2 below 1. And nothing is new.",__label__1

"Same as all the others, dull.: Same as all the other recent transformers movies, dull and bland, completely emotionless. The story lacks excitement, and only the occasionally good special effects made me sit through it.",__label__1

"Fun cheesy movie but not on prime instant video!!: Michael Bay movies are meant to be action packed fun cheesy goodness. Which this is. The reason I'm giving this a bad review is because Amazon Instant Prime has edited out parts!! It's a PG13 movie!!!!!! It doesn't need edits! Considering how much we pay a year for Prime, I expect to be able to watch the full movie.",__label__1
"Just a bad movie: Poorly acted, written and plotted. Sci-fi and action movies are my thing but I couldn't get through this one as it seemed like all involved just ""phoned it in"". Worst movie I've seen in a long time.",__label__1
"I Am A Fool For Having Suffered Through This Dreck: Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall story that makes a 1962 comic book look Shakespearean. Michael Bay you ruin everything you touch. And I'm worse for having seen this.",__label__1
Story too boring: The story is so boring. I still have not finished yet after three nights watching: I only take it for half hour.,__label__1
"THIS IS A HORRIBLE MOVIE!: My daughter and her friend gave this film a big thumbs down:""We hated it. We were bored out my minds, and couldn't understand the story line at all. The acting was moderate. The only good thing about this movie was that it made us super hungry, since it was 3 hours long!..... At least smear a little spot of dirt on ""angel's"" face by the end.""""So basically, don't watch it.""""Sorry, people. We are very frustrated right now.""",__label__1
"A simple question......: I have a question for the continuity people.....I liked the rest of the movie, but was upset to see one thing.....why is ""Eagle's"" ascent stage still on the moon when the autobots go to visit the wreckage?

"Ten Minutes of Action, Five Minutes of Drama, Two Hours and Twenty Minutes of Awkward Teenage Angst: I won't say that this movie doesn't have its moments, just that they are few and far between. And you know those horrible, horrible memories everyone grows up with, the kind that scream ""embarrassment"" at high volume when, a few years later, you are reminded of the fact that yes, you were stupid enough to say that in front of those people? This movie is chocked full of those moments.",__label__1
"Nothing special about the special affects: Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage. Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay.",__label__1
"Can't believe I gave this 2 stars: I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan I'll watch almost anything once. This is one of those one watch movies. A huge disappointment and not enjoyable at all. The first half of the movie is spent trying to make you lust after Huntington-Whiteley. She is so one dimensional that she's impossible to like, let alone think she's appealing. There was zero chemistry between Huntington-Whiteley and LaBeouf. They wasted half the film trying to show how LaBeouf could be the worst bumbler of all time and how everyone knew it. Somebody in the studio obviously doesn't understand the Sci-Fi audience.",__label__1

"Rent for the kids, but DON'T buy it.: Please for the love of God, don't spend more than $1 renting this shlock from Redbox. We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes. You find yourself having to close your eyes to avoid a headache.",__label__1

You would regret to have bought this version and should wait to get the later version with all the available added features.",__label__1
"no 3D version: I`ll make it short and come to the point quickly: I think its a shame that Bay is starting milking the cow too by NOT putting the 3D version in this set. Pirates 4, Thor, Tron and so many others included a 3D version. I won`t buy this release and wait (let`s see for how long) for the 3D release. I know many of you hate 3D - I love it on my 65"" panasonic and was soooo looking forward for this. just my personal opinion...",__label__1
"This is actaully worse than Transformers 2? yep, I can honestly say it is.: A boring Nasa storyline that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to begin with, sam gets a new girlfriend and is trying to find a job, along the way we still have annoying charectors such as the mom, the asian guy, some dumb momments with sam and his boss. movie is too long with no story, no charector development, with no action until the last 40 minutes and this is a 2 and half hour movie. If the robots had fought on the moon I think It would have been more interesting and a different location, instead we get a main villian robot that is not memorable, a repeat of the robots fighting and causing destruction in the city. special effects are amazing but it can't save how poorly written this movie is. its all visual with no substance.",__label__1
"I Was fooled again: After seeing Revenge of the Fallen,I thought this one would be way better,I thought they would have learned their lesson,but I was wrong.This movie is a 2 1/2 hour snoozefest.I paid 7.50 to see this,what was I thinking.Dont make the same mistake,just wait and rent it.Heres what you do.Rent it,get it home,Fastforward through the first half of the movie,also fastforward through all of the John Malkovich scenes.Then watch the second half,try to determine who the good bots and bad bots are,because theres so many its hard to distinguish.Shias new GF in this movie is super hot but thats not enough to save this movie,It will make hundreds at the box office because of Suckers like me.",__label__1
Quality: The HD streaming always fails...The movie itself was fun to watch and very enjoyable. It would be nice if the streaming quality held up.,__label__1
"Transformers: Dark of the Moon DVD: I purchased 2 of this item as Christmas gifts for 2 of my grandsons. They have both watched it more than once and have thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not have any problems with my order. It was received in a timely manner, and in the condition promised.",__label__2
"Must watch: Could not find this movie at the stores where I live, but sure found it on Amazon. This movie was a gift to my daughter for Christmas and I got it way ahead of time and she loved it.",__label__2
"Makes a great drinking game!: Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess...",__label__1
Transformers - AGAIN?: This film truly shows how filmmakers attempt to ride success. This movie is really bad. Even with some new blood (or should I say blonde) I couldn't hardly stand to finish the whole thing. But I did. What a waste.,__label__1
"Fun movie, but not worth buying at this price--my bad!: if you are like me and like to go through specials features and ""making of"" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. This is the second time I make the same mistake. The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else. It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature. Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release! The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie. I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom. As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake. I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY. What do you think? Any opinions?",__label__1
"Bad Bad Bad: I enjoyed the first movie. I didn't think the second was as bad as everyone thought. Wow, this one was just atrocious. I'm not going into specifics as I'm sure the other reviews have but do not spend the $4.99 on downloading this. Wait for it to come out on HBO or whatever.",__label__1
"Cheap, double dipping scumbags: While walking to the counter to PAY for this release, I turned it over to read what extras were included. NONE!!!!! Nothing!!!! I put it right back on the shelf. I am NOT paying full price for a bare-boned release! The greedy corporate thugs are counting on you to buy this, only to wave something a lot more enticing in front of your eyes when sales for this dwindle! Sick of these rip-off tactics!!! I have no sympathy for their loss of revenue from movie pirating! If they treated their customers with respect, perhaps the problem would not be so widespread!!!",__label__1
"Very Disappointing, No Special Features: There are no special features included in this version, which is a big contributing factor why I buy movies in the first place. Very annoying that this bare bones version is being sold at full price. More annoying still is the special features will probably come in the 3D version, which I do not intend on buying.",__label__1
Transformers 3: The delivery was prompt. The movie is an excellent source of entertainment. Action packed. I hope they make another one in a few years.,__label__2
"Good but disappointed: I have seen four 3D movies on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. I was disappointed. I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective. They don't send things protruding out at you like other 3D movies do. It doesn't have the WOW-factor that other 3D movies have had.",__label__1
"Autoawesome!: Haven't watched in 3d yet, but we all loved it at the movies, don't know what was up with Megan Fox picking Cowboys and Aliens over this movie. Even though it was a good movie it just didn't have that iconic childhood following to be a blockbuster. This is a must have in your collection.",__label__2
"Terrible: This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart.",__label__1
"I gave up after 57 minutes: Because nothing even remotely interesting happened so I decided to read a book instead (""Swimming Home"" by Deborah Levy).I'm glad I did not pay to go see this, I would have fallen asleep.",__label__1
awful: This is by far the worst Transformers movie that I have ever seen. I am glad I did not see this movie in the theaters nor bought this stupid movie. The scenes are so discombobulated and do not flow well together at all. The only one thing that could have deemed this movie is absent namely: Megan Fox vs. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. I keep watching this movie hoping it will get better but so far it is still awful. No more Michael Bay Transformer movies. I think the only way to redeem the Transformer name is to return to an animated movie. I recommend everyone to watch the animated Transformer movie and the original tv series released in the 80's.,__label__1
"Best movie out the the three: Im a huge fan of Transformers since I can recall, I even have to tattoos. And the movie in 3D is awesome, I just bought a LG 47LW6500 and a 3D BD player...what else can I say",__label__2
love it: I ordered this movie from Amazon in good condition. If I need any movies I will order from Amazon again.,__label__2
"Darkness rented from Amazon.com: Excellent video, true to the Autobot story. I missed Megan Fox but her replacement was a great Actress and easy on the eyes! I hope the series doesn't loose steam and die!",__label__2
Great Movie: The vendor mailed the movie quickly and it was new and the movie was great. Will order other movies from vendor.,__label__2
"It was great!: Forget what the naysayers reviewed. It brought me back to my childhood. I thought it had a good enough plot. Action was outstanding, and Optimus Prime's voice is the same as when I was a kid some 25 years ago. Those bits of nostalgia coupled with modern day CGI fulfilled this geek. And what were you expecting Shindler's List? L.A. Confidential? The first time you saw Sixth Sense? It's mindless fun and this fanboy was all for it.",__label__2
"Best one so far!: This is one badass movie. The cgi is spectacular. The 3d is not that great, but the action is crazy, it never stops. Cant wait for Transformers 4. Keep up the great work!",__label__2
"This is the version you want!: Not just because of the 3D, but because this is the version where they made an effort to optimize the picture! They released this on blu ray like like avatar was released. First they release the movie without any optimization and special features. Which means the picture looks better than DVD but not the best that blu ray can be.(which means a grainy looking picture that looks like the characters are in a sandstorm and there is a lack of detail that you expect in a blu ray). The they make the limited edition which is made the way a blu ray is supposed to be down. So if you are wondering which one to choose, this is the one you want! All the features with the visuals to boot!",__label__2
Epic: I love this movie and I love this franchise. Each movie keeps getting better and better. I'm glad the got rid of Meaghan's Fox.,__label__2
"It's ok...: Not much of a plot differance from the 2nd one... I saw them film in Chicago in 2010... That was the only cool thing about this movie, the Chicago back drop... Other then that don't buy this unless you saw it and liked it.. If you haven't seen it just rent it!!!!!",__label__1
good: I thought it was a good movie. I grew up watchig transformers. Its nice to see it brought to the big screen.,__label__2
"Great Visuals / Terrible Script: Glad this was free on Amazon Prime. Good effects, terrible plot.It was such a departure from the first two. I won't ever turn a movie off but this was as close as it gets.",__label__1
One bad movie: Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen...I watch Dark of the Moon. The cheesey (and canned) music score. The overused panning camera shots with a low sun hanging just over the horizon. The also overused helicopter shots. The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust). The inept plot. Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting. Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels. The endless stream of former A list actors showing up. Etc.This movie is another train wreck. Thank god I streamed it using Prime and didn't pay for it in the theater or on DVD.Ugh.,__label__1
"Really Really Bad!: This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. This film is too dumb for adults and way to crass for children. I don't know who's giving the good reviews, it must be highly paid movie industry workers. This movie is really, really bad!",__label__1
Horrible: It was painful to watch. I was tempted to give it two stars - I love his parents in this movie - until Sam and his girlfriend hopped into the company car after finding out her boss worked for the deceptions. It was just bad.,__label__1
"Yawn: 30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me ""hero"", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie.",__label__1
"Fun movie: In past Transformers movies, I couldn't make out the autobots vs decepticons in the battle scenes, but this one seemed to do the job a lot better.",__label__2
"Great Movie: I wouldn't have purchased this movie if I didn't like it, so obviously its a great movie. Hardly even miss Megan Fox. Great special effects, great action, funny.",__label__2
"Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Great entertainment. The 3rd Tranformers is not as good as the first, but MUCH better than the 2nd. My family enjoyed very much. Equally action-packed.",__label__2
cool robots bad acting sloppy story: The Decepticons play the Autobots like a used violin and demostrate Cybertron's AI still has a long way to go. While LaBeouf and Turturro act as if this movie is their character's last episode --- and they really over-act in this movie which is lacks the charm of the original TV cartoon.,__label__1
horrible: i want the 150 minutes of my life back. this is my first probably last movie review. this move was so bad it motivated me to take the time to do my fair share of trashing it a bit,__label__1
"Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Pretty violent, and I did not appreciate the strong language (cursing). Not suitable for my four year old to watch.",__label__1
"Terrible plot, interesting effects.: I'm a big fan of Transformers going back to the 1980s cartoons. This movie, like all the other recent ones, do a major disservice to the franchise. But at least it looks good while doing it.",__label__1
"One of the Worst Works of Mankind: If you've been wondering if our species is ascending or declining watch Transformers. If you haven't been wondering, I would like to take this opportunity to pose an ironic question, ""What is it like to be mindless?""",__label__1
"Wow this is bad!: If your 10 years old, then perhaps this is one of your very ""bestest"" films ever.......but other than that, this is close to being un-watchable for the rest of us. I only viewed it because of Spielberg's direction, but even he couldn't save this pathetic, phony, ridiculous movie. Just not for any person that actually thinks......or even smarter than average cats, dogs or monkeys. Total waste of time.",__label__1
Very dissapointing for Blu-ray and 3D!: This movie overall was disappointing. I so liked the first two that I really wanted this one in 3D. This was by far the worst 3D movie I have purchased. The flying paratroopers is the only reason to see this in 3D. This movie as like a very bad opera - it just went on and on and on and on ... so that when it did end you were so thankful it finally got to the inevitable conclusion.,__label__1
Movie was great!. If the movie was actually in the case!!!!: I had placed a huge order for my children for christmas. I was so upset when my children got the movie and there was no disc at all. so my bad review is with the company not with Amazon since they were kind enough to fix this problem and send another movie free of charge and free of shipping!! Thak you!,__label__1
Best Trans yet: This film drags in a few spots but its worth the waiting. This sequel has the most amazing effects of all of the Transformers. Plus it has a great storyline.,__label__2
"Too Chaotic: Although the modern Transformer series has incredible special effects, a movie needs more than that. The Transformers we new when we were younger were different, openly honest and strictly adhering to moral standards; but with the newer version,even the Good ones seem to be a bit more sinister and we're not always certain that they are on our side. The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style. I do not like many movies these days because Hollywood seems bent on reinventing the legend of whatever character or franchise they take on, for their own purposes. There is some of that here. With some unnecessary bathroom humor as well. Strictly for special effects fans only.",__label__1
More of the same bad script writing: They should have stopped after the first film. More bad acting filled in with fighting sequences that are way too long.,__label__1
"Well no.: Cheesy, rushed and too much Shia. Bay's twist on this is not liked by me and much better could have been done. But what do I know? The animated movie was excellent compared to this crap and even the games War for Cybertron and the Fall of Cybertron make this movie look bad. Action parts were ok.",__label__1
"Terrible science, terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible plot: I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of 'me grimlock' overheard in 'the Professional' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible movies.",__label__1
"Dark Day On The Moon: I have always had a problem understanding how anything which causes the degree of destruction as does the transformers can be of any merit for the planet. Then there is Shia, he makes me want to hurl every time I see him in these roles. The last thing I liked him in was HOLES.",__label__1
"Great Movie: Great movie, however DVD does not have any features. I am not sure if it worth to pay for the price, maybe wait till you can get it on sale.",__label__2
"Extremely repetitive, needed a haircut: I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?",__label__1
"Dark Side of the Moon: I'm a huge fan of Transformers - couldn't wait for this to come out on blu-ray so I could see all the captivating colors of the autobots - as only blu-ray can! Special effects are amazing, however the story line is weak compared to the first two movies. I was a little disappointed by the story and this is my least favorite installment. Still, if you are a fan as I am, it's a must have to make the collection complete.",__label__2
Great Movie!!: I could watch this movie over and over and over again. The graphics were totally awesome. A must see for all.,__label__2
"Graphics and Shia: Definitely is a trilogy. BUT guys its superb in its delivery graphically and Shia is just simply a good actor. More diverse roles he needs, yet ifthe movie was to be watched without biasses or even the knowledge-base of the past two movies the movie would rate 4 stars.Needs more distinguished and 'heavier' plot... so not 5 stars ie as an individual film).I'm being honest on the specific film here. In reference to its repetition of sequences andthe plot generality, the 'trilogy' per say is well ... a more critical discussion.Sticking with the one movie in crit! d",__label__2
"it works....i guess: This thing works sometimes, and its cheep. Other then that I don't have much good too say about it. It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water. And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road. I've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers, and I've been disappointed by them all. I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP. In the print world, you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea.",__label__1
"Good prints... bad compatibility: I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer.",__label__1
"bad usb connection on P1000: I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again...",__label__1

"Yep, they are safety pins: How do you review pins? They arrived as shown. They pinned my bedskirt to the box springs. I have no complaints/",__label__2
"Cheap metal: It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough. This rough point causes the material to cling to the safety pin rather than allow the pin to pass through easily.I would recommend the Dritz Quilter's Safety Pins. They are Nickel plated which makes them smooth and rust resistant.",__label__1

"Great backpack and a great value!: My son was in need of a sturdy bookbag. Rather than buy another inexpensive one that would surely fall apart, I sought out something more durable. I saw this JanSport bag in a local store and thought it was perfect! It was roomy enough for all his books, was well-made with strong and sturdy fabric and had awesome cushioned straps! Problem was, it was more than I was looking to spend.I did an online search and was amazed to find the very same bag on Amazon for less than half the price! I jumped on it. The backpack arrived within days and my son LOVED it. He claims it's so much more comfortable to carry his books now.Again, an awesome product at a rock-bottom price! Thanks Amazon.",__label__2
Retarded: This is essentially a live action G.I. Joe film for people with IQ's below 85. I walked out after about 5-10 minutes. I changed the ticket over to Jackass 2 and laughed harder than I have in years during a movie.,__label__1
Best movie ever!!: This movie kicks a** all the way and I can't wait for this to come out on DVD because it's an excellent movie!,__label__2
"Just a wanna be Rambo: If you are looking for a movie with bad acting-cliche lines-and never gonna happen action sequences this is the movie for you! Otherwise, I wouldn't even waste a Netflix rental on it.",__label__1
"An insult to marines: As soon as this movie started and I saw ""WWE"" on my TV screen I said ""This is gonna suck."" And it didn't disappoint. This movie sucked! Bad! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story didn't make a lick of sense. You got these bad guys who kidnap a random woman whose husband turns out to be Rambo. The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie. This movie is filled with every single action movie cliché and it didn't thrill in the slightest. It wasn't even bad enough to be good. It was just bad. It stunk.",__label__1
"Maybe 2 1/2 stars.: For Cena's first movie, it was okay. Lot's of explosives but I really wouldn't recommend the movie. Some okay jokes, and the story line was kind of weak. Typical ransom, give me back my wife type of movie. I recommend that you wait till the movie comes on television, and then decide if you want to buy it or not.",__label__1
The great Robert Patrick: It's back to the good old days.The action packed Schwarzennegger films where the kill-shot reigns with side-splitting dialogue.Problem is! Robert Patrick is the star. John Cena makes a credible Arnold but Mr. Patrick does a wonderful villain. He's got the lines and he's nailed the perfect bad guy with a flair that would make Hannibal Lecter cringe. A great job by the former star of The X-Files who made John Doggett a memorable experience.Action and blowup sequences are A-1 all the way.The perfect film for escapist violence.,__label__2
"Even Robert Patrick couldn't save it: I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark.",__label__1
"Anyone Who Gave This More Than 3 Stars...: ...is a lie and the truth isn't in them!!This movie was awful. From begining to end. Even the title didn't match. Marine? He was a Marine for all of 5 minutes of the movie!! LOL. But that isn't the worse part.The acting was terrible. Even the good actors (Robert Patrick) played terrible roles. The plot was unbelieveable, the action was unbelieveable, and the comedy was corny. I think the problem was the script itself, but I think GOOD ACTING could have pulled it off.As always I encourage people to see it, but don't spend your money on it. It's garbage.",__label__1
"The Few, The Proud, The Marines: Oh boy, it seems we have a wannabe Rambo in the house! Seriously this is one of those movies that you gotta watch to laugh at. The movie does have a lot of action scenes,stuff blowing up, people dodging bullets. and none of them are realistic. The good thing this movie boosts is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a few of lame one liners, it even breaks the third wall in one sceneThe movie tells the story of a recently discharged marine; he arrives home to begin a new life with his wife. They decide to take a road trip, have a good time together, but his wife gets kidnapped oh noo! Yeah so now Mr. Marine must save her. In the process he beats a lot of bad guys. Anyway it's an okay movie to watch when there's nothing on the teliMY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5",__label__1
"unvoluntarily ridiculous: Keep your hands of this movie, it definitley aint worth watching.The story is thinner than a crack ho on her last day on earth, unvoluntarily ridiculous and so placatively wanna-be-patriotic that homeland security shines outta your butt when ya bother watching this crappy movie.One of the worst movies i ve seen in years.",__label__1
"I know John!! Son went to High School with him!!: I did not like it very much...bought it because of the fact that my son went to high school with him and thought it would be nice to have. It was not as much action as I thought it would be....a little dull...but not bad for his first...know he will get better as the ""Rock"" did!!!",__label__1

this movie is uber lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! & uber boring!!!!!!: this movie stinks i hate this movie and this movie has ripped off rambo yes this movie ripped off rambo this movie stinks the director the producers the actors and actresses all stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is easily one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,__label__1
"Laughably stupid: I gave this movie 1 star for only one reason Kelly Carlson is beautiful,other than that the movie goes as follows,marine gets dishonorably discharged and seems to be ok with it,wife gets kidnaped,he gets beat up,knocked out several times,gets burned,blown up,by the most overdone explosions and walks away without a scratch,this movie is pure hollywood,it was a waste of money and time,you really have to wonder if the producers ever spent any time in the military,I have never met a marine worth his salt that had to go telling everyone (Im a marine), every soldier I have ever known that talks like that was always in some bar fight or some other altercation with someone,It was a laughably stupid movie",__label__1
"One of the worst movies ever: Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in movies. The Rock is doing it, Hogan did it for a bit. I did enjoy wwe's other movies but this...this was just plain bad. Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good",__label__1
"what a waste: john cena has to be the worst actor in history, wiht corny quote and stare one after another, it just shows how fargone the world of film has become, i honestly cant belive how people can pay for this. not only is john cena annoying his acting is unbearable, its worse then wacthing george bush's innauguration...dont buy it, your waisting your money, its a joke, i honestly dont get how someone could watch him unless ypu think he attractive, which unless you like people who act what their not, then he's ur type john cena is the worst thing to happen to wrestling",__label__1
We loved it!: My family watched the movie and loved it. It was exactly what we were looking for.....John Cena action flick to escape reality for a little while. Can't wait til his new movie comes out in March.,__label__2
"Typical action film with strange attempt at humor: This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous.",__label__1
"Mildly entertaining at best: This movie had bad acting and a thin plot. Could have been much better. Lots of action, lots of explosions but didn't seem like a good Blu-ray quality movie. It killed 2 hours but nothing i would recommend to a friend to watch.",__label__1
"Ha-Ha-Ha...: If the cover for this low-brow action piece wasn't a hint, then you're probably one of the producers target audience. One of the things I think hurts hollywood is its irrepressible desire to shove the American flag down our throats by making these ""patriotic"" movies. We have the American flag, Iraq, marines... and wrestling!!! I guess if cow-tipping is a hobby you enjoy as much as practicing a suplex, then this movie is for you.As for a review, it stank. If you see it on the shelf of your local video store, leave it there.If you're a hollywood producer, please stop making movies starring wrestling ""stars"". If your name is Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, John Cena (The Rock is OK) please stick to your day jobs.",__label__1
"Don't waist your money on this: This movie was a joke, a bad actor, and a bad story, makes it look like the Marine Corp gung ho killers.",__label__1
"lots of action~caution on the language: This movie has a lot of action, and my husband loved it. I do, however, warn you about the language. I wouldn't have any underage viewers present if you watch, and the language even made me want to leave the room, but if your okay with that, the movie is very action-packed.",__label__2
"For hard core action fans.: This is one for the hard core action fans. There's very little 'down time' to run for popcorn. If someone isn't getting shot, punched, etc. things are getting blown up or sunk in water. There is an action scene I haven't seen yet with a police car. Several of the action scenes are worth a rewind and I did appreciate the 'buff bodies'. You have to give these guys an A plus for working out.Chrissy K. McVay - Author",__label__2
"Marine Comedy: This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive, take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up, and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh.",__label__1
"If bogus got stars, this would have 10: As an ex-marine I can tell you that the only shred of realism in this thing was the marine being punished for doing well. He can afford a nice house and a new Lincoln Navigator on peon pay. He chases his wifes kidnappers thru a construction zone at 100 MPH, endangering everybody instead of just laying back and using the radio to tell the cops where to put a roadblock. He gets hit in the head with enough stuff to start a junkyard but never shows a mark, gets blown up at least twice without being even singed. The HiPo Camaro takes dozens of hits but they all miss the radiator, tires, electrical and fuel system. Not for anybody older than 10. It did have nice explosions, though.",__label__1
"new answer to the question ""What the worst movie next to Missing in Action I""?: This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life.",__label__1
"Non-stop action from beginning to end!: I was skeptical of this movie featuring a WWE wrestler (WWE wrestlers are notoriously bad actors) and because the movie was produced by the WWE rather a than a major motion picture company. However I was wrong. The movie was full of action and special effects. John Cena did a respectable job acting. The theme and plot were very entertaining, not cheesey or bogus. If you like action movies such as ""Arnold"" movies or Rambo movies then you will very much enjoy this movie!",__label__2
"Not a bad movie: To be honest , I gave it 4 stars but it's more like a 3 1/2 simply because it does have it's good points to it .This film take's us back to the ""later 80's action film ara"" and can be compared to some of Steven Sagals films , or even Dulf Lungren.I just can't get over the fact that it's John Cena in this film (and that's not really a good thing) His acting was OK and the action was good , but it's no ""Condemed"" with Stone Cold !In short , it's OK and that's about it . It will entertain and it isn't a waste of money or time .3 1/2 Stars",__label__2
"Painful to watch...: I watched this movie for some sign of a redeeming quality; and found none. The acting was terrible, the action scenes were dramatically staged and unrealistic, no plot, and they didn't even try to make it humorous. If you watch the special features, they beat the living daylights out of the main character who got injured numerous times during the creation. I felt bad for him because he was really trying. If they had a halfway decent director or photographer, they could have used this guy's effort and hard work to make a good movie. If you want to watch a good B action movie, rent Equilibrium or Dark City. Skip this one.",__label__1
"Bad...: ...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II"".",__label__1
"made me ashamed to have served: This is the first time that I've ever felt so compelled to write a review for a movie I thought was horrible. But this movie is that bad.I can't believe someone actually enjoyed this.The one liners, and that whole rock candy thing??? What was that all about? Was that supposed to be funny?Who wrote this anyway? He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.The acting was also some of the worst I've seen. I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.Oh, the explosions were impressive. Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.Thanks. I feel a little ""dumber"" for having sat through the whole thing.",__label__1
Awesome: I only went to this see this movie because i love john cena and hes sooo HOT. I dont like action movies AT ALL and my husband has to beg me to watch them. But this movie was incredibly awesome. It had me on the seat of my chair from beginning to end. Excellent job john triton.,__label__2
"MAKES THE RAMBO SEQUELS SEEM LIKE CITIZEN KANE!: I have to say this movie is beyond ridiculous! When watching an action movie like this, one should have an open mind and realize that this is a fatasy world, but....... ""The Marine"" is summed up in one sentence in the film. As one character says to Robert Patrick's character(who starred in T2 Terminator 2)and says this guy is like the Terminator!.......That was the funniest line in the movie, but this guy isn't the Terminator and he escapes too many sure deaths for me to take this movie any more serious than an old Looney Tune cartoon! The acting is terrible and the characters are not intersting.....in short...this movie SUX!",__label__1
"The missing songs...: Nero from NYC - you're absolutely right: unfortunately the best songs of the film are not included on this soundtrack. These are 'Hell', 'Sailors' and 'Whore' performed by the wonderfully strange band ""The Tiger Lillies"" from London, all available on their own CDs... Not really Zydeco, but great stuff, nevertheless!",__label__1
"Great score, terrible quality: The music on this album could be incredible.However, there is low-level line noise on every track, the audible range of the tracks seems like it's been ""chopped"", making all the tracks sound ""muddled."" One track should flow seamlessly to the next, but the mastering between tracks results in extreme volume level changes.I am by no means an audiophile, but the MP3 quality for this album is just terrible. (I don't know if the same mastering issues exist for the cd version of this album).",__label__1
Nice: This CD is the epitome of good soundtrack music. You'll get a variety of good music in this album. Definitely recommended.,__label__2
"Where is the music from the film that I bought this cd for?: I enjoyed the film and purchased the cd in search of the Zydeco song ""Your going to Hell"" but alas although it was the most pumping song in the whole film they left it off the sound track! Does anyone know the name of the song that I'm talking about and where can I find it?",__label__1
"Not satisfied with this item!: We ordered this plaque as a house warming gift. We were under the impression based on the photo, that the plaque would be able to be hung on the house. When we received the item, not only was the number of the house not in the center, like pictured, but it came with 2 steaks to be inserted into the ground, with no way to hang it on a house. I understand it says ""lawn"" in the title, but it is clearly pictured hanging on stone. I contacted Shopzeus stating that the number was not in the center and it couldn't hang on a house. They sent a new one, with the number in the center, but still unable to be hung on the house! I contacted Shopzeus again and asked for either a full refund or a plaque that can be hung on the house. It has been over 2 weeks and they have not answered my email. This item is very misleading and should not be pictured as it is, if it can only be used in the lawn. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and would never buy from Shopzeus again.",__label__1
"Disappointing on several levels: There is only a brief introduction to the images and the period this coloring book covers. That was one star off. However, we do need to keep in mind that this is supposed to be a coloring book, target audience probably children though frankly I know many adults who adore these sorts of books. The images however not simple black and white lines drawings but have shading and that interfers with coloring. Also many of the images are ""blurry"" or so details that I don't think it is much fun to color. But it could be a cool reference for clip art or examples of the gothic style.",__label__1
"heavily inked in plate repros of circa 1875 designs: Almost useless as a true coloring book due to the heavily inked in gothic designs. Some of the designs are highly detailed and intricate, yet totally useless because most of it is inked in already. The entire book consists of gothic clip art style 1875 ink-plate repros of gothic pillars, gothic crown molding, etc. The images are printed back to back on quality white stock paper, however, markers bleed through. NO limited recopy rights at all, not even for our own use. Not even just to recopy so we can use markers. The price does not justify the product at all.This is not a Dover Publication, it was published by Stemmer House Publishers. Best to stick with Dover, at least with Dover you know you're getting top quality in all aspects.",__label__1
"Dorothy TumbiUmbi: When I was young Lorne Doone was set for our final year. I never fininhed reading or did I like it. This time I found it a very good and well written, enjoyed and liked it very much. A fine picture drawn of life in hard situations hardly comprehended in our modern existant. Well worth reaading this book. Thank you Amazon.",__label__2
"One of the Most Romantic Stores Ever!: It's a love story, and it has everything: bandits, highwaymen, corrupt judges, criminal masterminds, heroes, villains, faithful friends, lovers, betrayals, robbery, murder, mines, runaway carriages, and beer for breakfast. It's written in classic 19th-century prose style, so don't be put off by the slow start. Slog through it, tough it out, fall it love with the great John Ridd and the beautiful robber's child, Lorna Doone. Set in Exmoor, it's based on historical events. The Ridd farmhouse exists to this day. Lorna Doone is a must read for everyone, at least once in a lifetime.",__label__2
"Lorna Doone - a Classic !: I was pleasantly surprised to find this book so readable- even by modern standards it is a good read, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even ..... but if you can deal with that, this is a good bet for anyone who would like a tale of England in the late 1600's... love, adventure, and even a little humor too!",__label__2
Lorna Doone: I bought this book for my friend Lorna for all she has done for me and she got a kick out of it,__label__2
An all-time favorite.: I first read this book when I was a child. It has always been one of my favorites. I cannot tell you how many times I have read Lorna Doone but I love it more each time.,__label__2
Driver Support: No Mac support. Boooo Hissss!No Win95 support? GOOD! Why are you still running that outdated OS anyway? At least upgrade to Win98.,__label__1
"Problems installing software, weak tech support.: When I run the software installation, it loads it's two executable files into my startup directory. This shouldn't happen.When I try to launch the emarker software, it says ""Cannot initialize encryption, Application shutting down"".I e-mailed their tech support for some ideas and the responder said they didn't think the software would work with Win98SE. ?????",__label__1
"Venus Fly Trap: I got one of the earliest examples of these new devices. They are simple to install and fairly simple to use. In essence, you put it on your keychain, and anytime you hear a song you like (and perhaps want to buy), you hit the button. Then, you attach it to your computer via the cradle, log on to Sony's eMarker website, and by selecting your city and station (you must remember what station you were listening to when you hit the button), it checks the time stored in the unit against the playlist supplied to the Sony website from each radio station. You can get some info on the song/artist, hear some clips, and if you're so-inclined, you can buy the complete song from Sony via download. This is a 'free service', unless you decide to buy the music. In that sense, the eMarker is a clever tool for Sony to sell direct-to-consumer, avoiding the other means of internet distribution now available, as well as circumventing the retailer.",__label__1
"Do not buy: Save your money. It's pure hype. If you listen to more than one station, you have to wade through several audio clips to figure out which one you liked. If you listen to anything but pop, it's useless. It's just a gadget to get you to buy CD's through their web site.",__label__1
"New Technology Needs Help: The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the ""24 Hour"" wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs.",__label__1
"Worthless Gadget: Great idea or so I thought. I fell for the marketing hype. This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp. You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web. If you were listening to a different station, you have to look it up on their site, which defeats the purpose of this thing. You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget. In fact, you can do it better without the gadget, because, emarker's coverage is limited (No AM, jazz, classical, or music videos). Save your money!",__label__1
"The $20 stop watch: Before you buy this thing, understand one thing. When you mark a song, you have to remember the station you were listening to at that time. So if you have 10 emarks, you have to remember the station you were listening to at the time of each of the emarks. I wondered about this detail before I bought the thing and found no mention of it anywhere on their website. I assumed it would mark the station somehow. My mistake. Learn from it.",__label__1
"It only remembers the time, not the station.: Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a ..clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you",__label__1
"Useless!!: I was sold this item only to learn, after opening the corresponding Web site necessary for eMarker function, that Sony was terminating the corresponding Web service in 45 days!!A great idea but no support.",__label__1
"Perfect Idea but just not ready: The eMarker is a wonderful and innovative idea. The size is right and the price is reasonable (a little cheaper would be nice, but its acceptable). The big problem stems from the fact that Sony has no Mac support... or support for a number of other platforms as well. It's not like its hard to make the eMarker compatible with these systems. Sony is only shooting themselves in the foot. If this product were to support the Mac, it would be a 4 or 5 star product.",__label__1
"emarker.com to shut down 9/30/2001: Do not buy the emarker. It is being shut down by Sony on 9/30/2001. I received the following email from emarker.com on 9/5/2001:We will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01.To keep your eMarks information, just print the screens from your eMarks pages.For eMarker refund information, please click here.(emarker.com)Thanks for your support.The eMarker Team",__label__1
"Good if you listen to ONE radio station at all times!: I live in Phoenix, AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker. The main problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before the radio and song information is updated on E-marker's web page. Also, if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker. Trust me, it is hard to remember which one of your 3 listed radio stations you were listening to, especially if it was more than 24 hours ago - I thought the whole point behind this product was to let you not remember!",__label__1
"Good idea, needs LOTS of work: The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking. I live in NYC, media capital of the world, and if it doesn't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations, it won't work anywhere. If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing. It is very unreliable, I have yet to see it work more than 3 times, and I have owned it for well over a month. If you want to get it, DON'T. At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point.",__label__1
"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE PRODUCT: Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest.",__label__1
"Not Needed -- Free Alterative: This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)",__label__1
"Small Device... Huge Disappointment: When I first heard about this I was elated, no more guessing what the song I was listen to is called. Then I connected to the website. At the time I had a 28K modem. Trying to access Sony's flash-enabled site was undesirable, if not impossible. I had to wait half an hour just to figure out what a three minute song was called. Also, the fact I still had to write down the station I was listening to. Doesn' that defeat the purpose of this toy?",__label__1
"Not so hot...: I thought this product would be great, and help out my kids a lot!! My daughter hates it and it is so confusing. We can't find a lot of just regular songs. It is easier just to call the radio station and find out yourself.",__label__1
"Incomplete: Nice idea, poor execution. It simply does not work well, and is therefore much more trouble than it's worth.",__label__1
"waste of cash: This was the biggest waste of money ever created. If you want to know the song that much, call the station and ask them, they don't mind, really.",__label__1
"great BUT: great product BUT some guy was working and going to call it the iMusic or something to work on Mac & PC but no stupid sony bought it from him now they get the money for HIS credit and its PC only I HATE THAT STUPID SONY SO NOW I NEED TO USE VIRTUAL PC! THANKS A LOT SONY,or should I say PHONY! (yes i know caps means souting)",__label__2
"THE WORST THING EVER CREATED: I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!",__label__1
"New Technology!: This is new technology, what can we say? It might have its occasional bugs (not being able to get songs in a few days) but these are things that can be overlooked. Its new for crying out loud! The best way to get these bugs ironed out is by supporting the product and giving Sony feedback. The interface of this product is excellent and simple...a button and a tiny LCD screen. If you don't know how to use this then...technology isn't your buddy I guess. As far as coverage and the speed in which certain radio stations provide feedback is the sole responsiblity of that station for the most part (most stations take 24 hours to get a song. others might take maybe 10 minutes or so), and NPR support would be very much appreciated. Not every location on the surface of the earth is supported (yet) but as far as I'm concerned an e-mail request to Sony could help to do the trick. Overall, the product is great and it is a great Sony investment.",__label__2
This thing rocks!: I got this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. I am not so sure what all the bad reviews are about. All I know is that the E-marker worked perfectly for me and I use it all the time. I live in Boston and the songs are very accurate. Sometimes it takes them a day or so to figure out the song (reason for 1 less star) if the song is an 80's song.,__label__2
"Don't do it! It's still in beta...: Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it ""automatically"" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true...",__label__1
Great idea...bad support: I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea. I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs. I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it. To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98. I am currently running Windows ME. I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response. I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space.,__label__1
rip off: no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony,__label__1

"SLOW very very slow: Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker.",__label__1
"Good product, but not really needed by younger people: This Product is truly a great product. I found out about this a few days ago. This really is a great product, and it is easy to use, but this isn't really needed by anyone 13-24 because we regularly tune into the radio and/or watch MTV almost everyday. I could see this useful for older people, probably 40+, but it isn't really too practical for a younger generation.",__label__2

"Xenote itag was far better: Sony just stole the idea from Xenote, iTag was far better and it was Free. iTag was working and has far more station, it was so simple to use that you just needed a single plug to work. They steal idea and they are not even abble to steal it correctly. It's just a shame for a such big companie as Sony.",__label__1
"As already stated, a good idea with a lousy execution: I often listen to the radio and don't know what songs are called so I could download em. I saw an advertisement for this product, and decided to try it out. Everything went well until the first time I uploaded the emarks. For some reason 3 or 4 of each song was comming up. I deleted them, but was unable to delete the emarks on my emarker. I was very dissapointed in this product, espically the software and I strongly dissuade you from buying it.",__label__1
"CAREFUL! SONY rips you off!: I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-(",__label__1
"Does what it says, BUT. . .: This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review. Current users are being offered a refund, but my guess is if you buy one now you won't get that.I'd write more detail, but I have to go print hardcopies of my eMarks. :(",__label__1

"Sony EMarker: A great way to find new music.: I just got the emarker, and right away i love it. It is small, cute and it fits right into your USB port. You dont even need the cradle.The negative parts are that you have to remember which station you marked on if you listen to more than one station, but i dont so its not a preblem for me. Another problem is the space, but thats easy because you can just go online and upload them, and free up your space. One really cool thing about it is that you can mark songs from covered TV stations, or mark songs when you are out of town. Overall, its a really great and smart product and its really easy to use! I give it 5 stars because the cons aren't worth fretting over. I am a satisfied customer.",__label__2

I love my Sony e-marker!: You do have to remember what station you were listening to but I usually only listen to three different stations and it's easy to switch between the stations on the web site. I also like the sound clip option that is available for many of the songs. If it's been a few days since I've heard the song and I'm not sure about the station I can listen to the sound clip and easily identify the song.I teach an indoor cycling class and have found this to be an invaluable tool for finding great songs!,__label__2
Works on country and western stations too!: I am a country and western fan in Memphis. This new Sony product is great! I meam really great. I don't have to remember songs I hear on the radio anymore. Definitely worth the $19.99 I paid. Get one!,__label__2
"Ruined by neutering the artwork: I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book.",__label__1

They sure were scary but not enough to completely get rid of them! I will never buy this version.

"These are not the Stephen Gammel illustrations!!: I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries.

"Worthless Edition.: Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools.",__label__1

"NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST!: Because I remember loving and being absolutely terrified at these books when I was a kid, I recently purchased all 3 and just received them today. To my horror (and not in a good way) I found that they've published them with a DIFFERENT ILLUSTRATOR! With all due respect to Mr. Helmquist (the new guy) and certainly to Mr. Schwartz (the original author), these books were made for me by the art of Stephen Gammell. I'm sure they did this because so many parents tried to get the books banned in their day because of the ghastly drawings, but this is really a tragedy. I would suggest looking elsewhere for original copies of the books as they should be seen. Don't buy them here - you'll be missing out on part of what made these books so wonderful in the first place.",__label__1

"These are not the books you grew up with...: Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself.",__label__1
"Illustrations are Terrible!: First off, I must say that I used to read these books when I was younger (even though I'm still a kid). And the stories in this book are the original great stories, but the ILLUSTRATIONS the best part of the original version, have been CHANGED. That really sucks because the new pictures are so watered down they aren't scary anymore. The new title should be Not Scary Stories to Tell in the dark.",__label__1
"Not worth buying--BUY THE ORIGINAL!: I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?",__label__1
"Another person who can't believe they changed the art.: Reading these books left a huge impression on me as a child. The tales were scary, but the original artwork was what was truly horrifying.

Terrible mistake.",__label__1

"Jake's: I did not like this book because it was not like a complete story. It just had little mini stories in it. I also did not like it because some of the authors who wrote the stories did not finish them. One more reason is there are a lot of pages, but it is not hard so it makes it too easy to read.The book Scary Stories is a book filled with about 10 different stories. It is very scary andit just makes you want to scream! This book will scare its reader half to death.The type of reader that would like this book is maybe someone who watches a lot of horror movies. The reason is because it really scares you. The reader would also have a strong stomach because it is a gross book.",__label__1

Big disappointment for me. my advice? read it when you are younger, it might acutally be scary then.",__label__1
"Horrified, and not in a good way: To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these books!, My highschool age son can't recall any of the stories but still talks about the ""super creepy"" pictures.

I truly hope the publisher reads these reviews if only to realize what a ridiculous decision changing the artwork was.",__label__1
"Warning for customers: Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition.",__label__1
"This was just a mistake.: Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations.",__label__1
"Big Thumbs Down for New Illustrations: I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them.",__label__1

"My Childhood! :(: While the stories are good, what made these books for me as a kid and most people I know was the artwork. MAN, they scared the crap out of me as a kid as well as everyone else.

Get the ones with the original art folks, there is a whole new generation out there to be as freaked out as we were.",__label__1
"Not the Best Version: While Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark is a classic children's book, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and find the original version with Stephen Gammell's illustrations.Alvin Schwartz's words and Stephen Gammell's drawings simply go together, and your children deserve to be treated to the full and correct experience granted by the combination of Schwartz and Gammell.Yes, Gammell's illustrations are more frightening, though no more graphic, than Helquist's.

"After 13 years, I still can't look in the mirror at night: My title should say it all, but I suppose I will talk a little here as well. This set of books is unbelieveable in the sense that Schwartz's storytelling knows exactly how to get to you. I'm a senior in college, and yet I still remember quite vividly reading the stories and being afraid to go near the back of our yard because it backed up to a field. In book two (I believe) the story of the thing in the mirror STILL gives me chills at night (my dorm room has a full-length mirror in it, and I hang my robe over it at night!)And, of course, my father knew just what to do to make me really remember the stories...like sneaking up behind me when I was feeding our rabbits at night at the back of the yard (next to the field, of course)I would highly recommend this collection of stories to anyone who is young at heart, or just wants to scare the pants off of their child (or sibling). The memories are well worth the cost of the books!",__label__2
"You Think the books are Creepy? Listen to the cassettes!: I remember reading these as a kid and then buying all of them a few years later. The stories were great the illustrations were creepy, and like a lot of reviews, my little brother was scared of that picture in the haunted house story. well, ok it was pretty darn ugly. This is one of those books that still gives me the chills especially fro mthose pictures? oh what a warped mind that artist had but what creative drawings they are!Now, if you think the books are scary, try listening to the cassettes. i am in my twenties and the voice of the narrator and that creepy music gives me the willies. try listening to it in a room by yourself, and see how long it takes you to run for the door! The Scary Stories and More Scary Stories cassetes (i am not kidding) it is a kid's tape and that music will creep you out. listen to it! pick up the book follow along and see how long you last!",__label__2
"LOVE the stories, HATE that the publisher destroyed the artwork: As a child, I was terrified by these stories and the accompanying illustrations. I was quite upset, upon buying this for my son, to find that the publisher had commissioned new artwork. I'm sure they thought it would make it accessible to a younger audience, and if you're an overprotective helicopter parent who doesn't want your kid to be scared, maybe they're right...but then why buy the book in the first place?I have nothing against Mr. Helquist - he's a very talented artist. But, his illustrations are far too tame for this book. I see no reason to have separated the stories from the original illustrations, and I'm spent the extra money to buy a gently used copy of the original book. It's equivalent to The Velveteen Rabbit or Peter Rabbit with new illustrations...an abomination, and NOT of the good, scary kind!",__label__1
"Buy the original.: I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed.",__label__1
"Replacing Gammell's art is a mistake!: This series influenced me as an artist in profound ways, and it was all because of Stephen Gammell's illustrations. I remember staying up late at night and just absolutely loving the how terrified it made me feel. It's very sad to me that children today aren't going to be able to experience the same thing because Gammell's illustrations have been stripped out and replaced by inferior, less emotionally impactful illustrations.I'm just happy that I went out of my way as an adult to buy multiple compies of Gammell's version before they were pulled from shelves.TO THE PUBLISHERS: Please make Gammell's version available to the public, so parents can make the choice about which version to buy their children.

"Gammell Made this Series Great: With respect to Alvin Schwartz, there's nothing terribly inspired about the writing, but it is a children's book and I adored it when I was young. What made these books incredible, was Stephen Gammell's artwork, of which I'm still a huge fan. I was very young when I was given these books for the first time and I would poor over the images, staring at each one. And yes, they scared me. But that was the fun! They didn't traumatize me, they just scared me in a delightful way. Releasing a new edition of this work without Gammell's art is like slapping two plain pieces of bread together and calling it a sandwich.",__label__1
"Artistically censored, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS EDITION!: While walking through Barnes and Noble after Christmas, I was wondering how to spend my gift card. By chance, I decided to travel down memory lane and pick up the boxed set of my favorite scary story collections as a child. Horrified (in a bad way), I looked at the shell of the books I once loved as an elementary school child. The original pictures made this collection so unique! For whatever spineless reason, the publisher decided to replace the original ghastly pictures with tame and watered-down versions. Sure, the stories are the same...but the artwork just doesn't fit. It is blasphemy to mess with such perfection. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS VERSION BY PURCHASING IT! Instead, hunt down the originals and buy them. You will be glad you did!",__label__1
"Great for story telling: While I do admit that these stories are no longer capable of scaring me, I also understand the fact that...this is a children's book. That being said, if you are not 12 and under, you might find some of the stories rather bland-- especially if you're a serious horror fan.Anyway, this book is great for campfire/sleepover/Halloween party-type settings. They're pretty short, but still quite enjoyable. My father read these books to my siblings and I as children during the month of October, and they scared the crap out of us.The illustrations....weird, scary, freaky stuff. Bottom line. In my opinion, the pictures are even scarier than the actual stories. I'm 26 now, and some of them still creep me out to this very day. So, if you're intending to read these stories aloud, then make sure that you show the pictures to add to the scare factor.Overall, I still enjoy this collection of stories. I highly suggest giving them a shot.",__label__2
This is an amazing collection of folklore!!!: This book came out a long time ago. I read it when it first came out and it introduced me into the world of ghosts and and lore. I was 12 years old then in 1982 and even now when I pick it up to read....it still takes me back to the feeling...when I first picked it up and sent shivers down my spine...in a fun way of course. The stories and the drawings were perfect together. A great book. I have all 3 volumes now and I hope he comes out with a 4th one soon.Thanks Alvin and Stephen for scaring the pants off of me when I was 12.,__label__2
"Not what I remembered as a kid...: This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple ""classic"" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile",__label__1
"Good for younger readers: [Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will enjoy it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven Kind book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier.",__label__1

"History of Fantasy: Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom.",__label__2
"Average Lost Civilization Fantasy: Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5.5/10The writing style is good and all the elements of a great story are present. If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right. Perhaps the author felt that a simple adventure needed a twist of some sort. Well it did feel twisted, but not in a good way.Claus Kellermann2006 April 15Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com",__label__1

"Bellydance Magical Motion: I am a first-timer and it can be rather intimidating to admit for an older woman in her mid-forties! I wanted a video that was decent, and this one surely is. Atea's moves were clear and it helped me to get a good start, but I quickly became bored with it because it lacked FLOW, and I was disappointed that the moves that she so clearly shows do not connect together to form a dance routine. This is what I am looking for. For a beginner to be expected to make a dance out of a bunch of new moves is unrealistic, and I will continue to look for a video that will offer this. If I am to dance like this in front of my husband, (which is mainly why I am learning) I would not be able to show him a routine by learning this video because I am a beginner and don't know how to put the moves together yet. The whole idea is BellyDANCE, and not just Belly EXERCISE, and with the CONFIDENCE I need to dance this way!",__label__1
"disappointing: I was very dissapointed with the quality of this video. During the entire video, you could see the woman reading the cards behind the camera. The ladies did not teach any moves that you could not just make up on your own.",__label__1
"very simple interpretation of bellydance: I take group bellydance classes and have been to seminars and workshops. This is bellydance but only the very simplest form. Atea is ok and this is a good tape to start with if you are not sure how serious you are about learning. It introduces you to things like veil and zills but it does not instruct you on them. If you are sure you want to dance you should shop around spend just a little more money getting a tape from someone/troup that dances a style you are interested in and has a well known face and name. For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several.",__label__1
"Perfect introductory video: This is a great video for learning basic belly dance technique.I am a professional dancer, and I recommend this video to women who are interested in learning how to belly dance.Atea has a very gentle demeanor, so the tape is not too intimidating for a beginner; she covers the basics well however, so that students who choose to continue with real-life classes have a good foundation to build upon.Atea covers finger cymbal (zil) patterns, slow (taqsim) movements, isolations and shimmies.There is a whole section (5 min. or so) at the end where women dance in different costumes, so that you can see how the moves can be put together.",__label__2
"Very helpful: I have been taking Belly Dance lessons for several years. I found this tape very helpful and the instructions clear. I think the intent of the tape is to introduce certain movements and let the viewer be creative. So if you are looking for a full workout you will not get it from the tape. You have to make your own. But that is one of the beauties of the tape. If you want to dance in the privacy of your home or if you are thinking of taking lessons, I think this would be great for you. It is a very gentle tape. Do not be fooled by the 1996 date listed here. That must be the reprint date, my tape said 1985 which explains the dated hair and makeup. Atea is not the most animated speaker but I think that is in line with gentle nature of the tape. I think the tape is very much in the spirit of belly dancing as it encourages the viewer to use her own style.",__label__2
"Belly Dancer from L.A.: Great video for intro to belly dancing and for reinforcing what you already know. I love this video, I also bought their Belly Dance Fast Moves, and Slow Moves, great, great, great, training videos. Also highly reccommend ""The Ancient Art of Oriental Belly Dance""",__label__2
"beginners only, maybe: Beginners who would like a quick view into some dance might take advantage of this video. There is an attempt to cover a lot of ground, but none of it is done well. Altea is too angular, stilted and her dancing is not that interesting. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for quality dance instruction videos. I will say that this is the first video that I've seen that touches on rhythm and zill work. The variety in costume is interesting, but is not worth the price. I recently acquired several of the Neena and Veena series of dance tapes. These are excellent beginner tapes, they are fun and interesting and they show a great little dance at the end as a reward for your work-out. This series would be a better choice for beginners.",__label__1
"These videos are horrible!: I'm sorry, but these are horrible for teaching belly dance. Atea is very stiff & stilted & her chorus dancers CANNOT dance! It is absolutely Scary!I have never seen anyone (in person or in a video) dance the way that they do in this video. If you are interested in learning to dance, please, choose another instructor!",__label__1
It's a shame there are not 0 stars on ratings: Reasons not to buy this video:1. She reads from cue cards the entire time.2. She's extremely stiff and boring.I have only watched this video once in the two years that I have owned it.,__label__1
Scary: I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like.,__label__1
"There are far better tapes out there...: If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance.",__label__1
"Frail White Women Wriggle About: While the basic instruction is passable, the technique of most of the dancers, including the instructor, is mediocre to poor. What's truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There's an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a ""wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband"" sort of vibe. Culturally divorced and ugly-American scary. Made me want to shave my head and get tattoos.",__label__1
"should have known better: For basic instruction this tape is OK. Her oral description of the techniques is clear. Atea is not relaxed at all in her instructions or moves. In the instruction part of the video she seems like a puppet controlled by strings. She is too skinny, unattractive and doesn't even have an attractive navel. She fails to hold your attention. Her other dancers are a bit better, but the whole tape seems so contrived and does not move with a natural flair. For verbal instruction, OK, for visual efects you can get much better. And the dance at the end is a real joke. Your money is better spent on Suhaila!",__label__1
"Not My Favorite: I found this tape very disappointing, it was fun to watch once, but the amount of information provided was very small and too choppy. There are many belly dance instructional videos available which are more interesting, better taught and more informative about how to dance and which provide you with a workout as well. My recommendation is to keep looking.",__label__1
"Excellent introduction, not workout video...: I really got into belly dance workouts about 6 years ago and purchased this video at that time. I remember hating it and thinking that it was the most worthless video I'd seen. After falling off the belly dance wagon, I now lead a group of women who are learning to belly dance using instructional videos. In going through my collection I revisted this video and realised that it would have made a great introduction to the world of belly dance. I plan on teaching a new group next year and will use this video the first night for those who are interested in the history and basic moves. I am so glad that I gave this video another chance.",__label__2
"Great Introduction - A classic: This was one of the first Bellydance instructional videos on the market and I believe Atea did not have the in front of the camera experience and production assistance of many of the slicker more current videos/DVDs.Despite Atea's slightly stiff appearance and the somewhat dated aspects of this production, the essential information (and many of the bellydance fashions) are classic and have not changed very much at all. It is a great introduction to the dance, basic moves, history, and costuming.",__label__2

"Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write: Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge.

"The original recording probably sounded good, but the mastering on this CD is poor...: Whoever mastered this CD had no idea what they were doing (this makes me wonder what other CDs on this label are like). They use about one-quarter of the dynamic range available with 16-bit audio. Five bucks is pretty cheap for the disc, but you get what you pay for in this case. I'd probably opt for the other Eddie Fisher CD that has multiple albums (one of them being a Christmas CD) on it.",__label__1
"the other reviewer is right: Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the sound on this album and it's so bad that it makes this album unacceptable and a waste of your money. What a shame! Although I can clearly tell there was nothing wrong with Eddie Fisher's performance of this set of songs; the sound quality (and probably the mastering) of these tracks is every bit as poor as the other reviewer states that it is.Therefore, I would recommend one of two alternatives. Diehard Eddie Fisher fans will probably want both! First, there is the very good (even though it's currently out of print) CD entitled ""Songs for Christmas"" by Eddie Fisher which has two bonus tracks by Frankie Laine. Second, there is the CD that contains the music from three of Eddie's record albums entitled ""Eddie Fisher Sings;"" ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" and ""Christmas with Eddie Fisher."" In short, you'll be much better off with one or even both of these two other albums.",__label__1

"The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh: I'm not exactly going out on a limb to say this is going to be the same transfer used almost five years ago by NoShame films. The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh is a pretty good giallo, I'd give the film itself 3 stars. If you didn't buy the out of print NoShame disc this may be a good option.It will be interesting to see if this is indeed the same transfer from NoShame and if it will include the great extras from that disc. Also, if it isn't a new transfer and doesn't have the extras, it will be funny that the NoShame disc from five years ago was list priced at $19.95 while this is listed as $24.95!Time will tell but beware of this shady company, who charges more and gives you less.",__label__1

"Fine product: I received my Hi-Tec Altitude boots and am very pleased. I had purchased a Hi-Tec product from a retailer some time ago and was pleased with the fit, in particular. The Altitudes are solidly made, fit very well, are comfortable and as waterproof as described. I have shopped extensively for waterproof boots for trekking through the rain, snow and slush of New York City. I walk 20-30 blocks a day in these and they perform very well. I have been unable to find a similar pair of boots at this price anywhere I have shopped. I recommend these highly.",__label__2
"great 4 hiking: The ""Fours"" recently purchased are just as comfortable and supportive,right of the box-as were my two previous ""Fours"". My first pair just wore out after four years of constant hiking. Unfortunately, the second pair, after two years of Catskill hiking lost its waterproofing ability but I believe that was so because of a seam opening between the uppers and sole; it has however remained my fair-weather hiking boot. My newest""Fours"" are terrific. I had to get them in second choice,black. I'll get used to them.",__label__2
Awesome hiking boot: These are my 1st pair of Hi-Tec boots and I could recommend them to anyone looking for a quality product at a great price.,__label__2
"Not Good Anymore!: I have owned these boots for years. They are very good Quality and very Comfortable. They lasted me winter after winter. In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times. Now for the pair I ordered, not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer. The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove. Assuming they were the same, I purchased a pair from Amazon (which is priced excellent) but they did not fit proper at all. The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something... and are no longer the same. Which is too bad. So as far as Amazon goes... ""flawless as usual"" Returning them was not a problem. Just beware of these boots. Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON, CANADA :)",__label__1
"Excellent for the Price: My ex bought these for me for $70 to get me into hiking here in the Cascades around Seattle (I have always hiked wearing regular shoes, but on flatter terrain in Northern California). I have always worn them with hiking socks and liners and they have been phenomenal. I think the longest hike I've done is 8 or 9 miles in a day, but I've done quite a bit of vertical including Mailbox and Snoqualmie Mountain and these have never let me down. After two years I can still slosh through creeks and melting snow and I've never gotten wet feet. The boots have held up well and look as though they'll last another year or two of hiking and snowshoeing.",__label__2
"buyer of boot: This is my second pair of this Hi Tec boot. The first pair lasted a very long time and was very comfortable the whole time. They break in right away. For years I was a die hard Danner buyer and I can say these beat my last pair of over priced Danner hikers hands down. (really they were more sneaker than hiker -I still love my Danner steel toes for a work boot) But my favorite thing about these Hi Tec boots are the eyes and hooks -THEY ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER OWNED. The laces last forever because the eyes and hooks are so smooth and rounded. Like I said, just bought my second pair -five star goodness.",__label__2
"Great product: Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value.",__label__2
"Good Deal On Amazon: I have bought about 20 pair of these boots over the past 6 or 7 years. I usually buy them 2 pair at a time and wear one for work and one for good.Even when you buy them at the buy one get one half price in stores the price on here is by far cheaper than anywhere else.They are comfortable, waterproof, last a long time and are light weight.",__label__2
"Seems like a nice pair of boots.: I have only wore these boots a couple of times, so I may be reviewing them too soon. As other reviewers have stated they don't seem to need a break in period, but there is a certain ""learning"" period. I say this as a person who literally has worn nothing but tennis shoes for years. The learning is getting used to the extra weight and bulk on your feet. I bought these to be a part of my ""bug out"" plan. I will soon be going on a real hike on rougher terrain to see how they feel then. Plus until I have put many more mile on them to see how they hold up I can't say for sure how many stars they deserve. I give them 4 for now and assuming 200-300 miles from now they are still in good shape I would change it to 5.",__label__2

"Only shoe my husband will wear: Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future.",__label__2
Very good for the price: This boot fits to size and is comfortable. I would purchase again. I use to purchase boots from LL Bean.,__label__2

"Outstanding boot at a great price: This is the first time I have purchased hiking boots online. I hike a lot. 40+ miles per week generally. I wear out hiking boots in about four months, and am getting tired of driving all over the place trying to find something that fits, and isn't too expensive. These are great! Comfortable right out of the box. Sturdy but still flexible enough to move with your foot. I have only just started with them - but at this price, and with the Amazon Prive fast and free shipping: I will be coming back here for more when I wear the treads off of these in a couple hundred miles.",__label__2
Overhyped?: Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box.,__label__1
"Great boot, Sturdy, Comfortable, But those darn laces!!: They keep coming untied! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. The boot is waterproof, it is comfortable, wont give you calluses or corns. But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it, they will inevitably become undone! The first time: ""umm? maybe I should tie them tighter"", The second time: ""just a little tighter, Ugh it's cutting my circulation"", The third time: ""Ok this is ridiculous, let me try tying em different"", the unfteenth time: ""you m$#%^ stupid $%^ Boot from hell $%^&..."" lol I threw the boots into a lake and hiked in my sandals the rest of the way... Never again will I buy boots with hooks for tying...thanks for reading",__label__1
"Poor quality control: I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect. After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV, I purchased a pair with high expectations. However, my first pair had a defect in the left shoe. It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt. At first, I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots. However, it did not help, and my foot continued to hurt. Today, I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size, and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion. I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all, my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold. 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control.",__label__1
"Good enough: I had to return the first pair, each side felt completely different in how they fit.The second pair fit well and are pretty comfortable, I imagine they will be better after break in. They seem well made. I gave four stars because I believe the insoles could be a little better.I bought the black, but after a hike on a dusty trail I realized brown would have made more sense. Oh well.As usual, Amazon was outstanding with it's service. Both orders were received in one day even with two day prime shipping. The return of the first pair couldn't have been easier.",__label__2
"These boots are much darker than the picture: Length:: 0:05 MinsI researched all types of hiking boots on the web, and these are the best. Good durability, comfort etc. I finally ordered the boots and waited. Finally the boots arrived, and yes they were very comfortable and arrived in good condition. Unfortunately the Dark Chocolate color is so dark that it is almost black. I am sure this will grow on me, but the picture on the web site is inaccurate and gave a false expectation. The picture is just a little darker than the CHOCOLATE color, but the reality is different. Actually the color is nice and it will hide the dirt, just not what I expected.",__label__1
"Cheaply made boot: Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!",__label__1
Not comfortable: These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable. I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day. The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up. I would not recommend these to anyone.,__label__1
"good boots: i usally buy these boots from famous footwear and pay like 80 to 90 bucks so i found them on amazon alot cheaper, thanks",__label__2
Great boot for the price: Just got back from a 9 mile hike in the Smoky Mountains. These boots did great. Very comfortable and held up well on the terrain. Highly recommended.,__label__2

"Happy Feet: These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!",__label__2
"as good as advertised: Yes, these boots are comfortable. They soften after a few miles of walking. They keep your feet warm and dry, especially with my smartwool socks. Order your normal shoe size, they will be just right with medium weight socks. I won't wear these around the house, running shoes are more comfortable. These will be for hiking, their intended purpose, which they do well. These were the best value that I could find anywhere.",__label__2
"quality hiking boots in good price!: I found this boot very light and comfortable plus the fact that it's waterproof. it fits perfect in my size, it's warm and breathable too. I liked the colour very much and I was very pleased to find the product in such a good price, compared with other hiking boots that they are not waterproof at all. So far I haven't had the chance to try my boot in a heavy terrain like mud or snow but I believe that they are made for such surfaces.",__label__2
"Warm & Comfy: These boots are some of the most comfortable that I've ever worn. Even after being on my feet for more than 6 hours my feet felt good. The boots are very warm which is kind of a draw back since I live in Las Vegas. However, after a day of work I was pleasantly surprised to find my socks were still dry. These would probably be best suited for cold climate hiking, but they work pretty good in the desert. Well worth the money.",__label__2
Great boot. Light but rugged.: This boot is well constructed for a light weight boot. I experienced minimum break in time with no hot spots. Good support and quite comfortable. I have not hiked in wet conditions so I cannot speak to the water proof feature. The boot runs true to size. I would buy another pair if these were damaged or lost.,__label__2
"BEST SHOES EVER: I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT",__label__2

"Great boots for the price: I bought these boots because my $40 Wal*Mart boots were not getting the job done. These provide excellent support and are very comfortable. I bought them 1/2 size large and they fit perfectly. Don't get these boots if you are going to be working in the cold a lot; they breathe well and are great for cool to hot weather, but it does not take long for your feet to get cold on a day that never gets out of the 30s.",__label__2
"Great purchase: Purchased these boots on Amazon two weeks ago. They were delivered in about 3 days and the fit was perfect. I have found them to be lightweight and very comfortable. And most important to me, since we get lots of snow, the boots keep my feet warm and dry. These boots delivered!",__label__2
"A really good pair of shoes: These are really good shoes. Great look. Good comfort. No break-in. Very sturdily built. Good price. True to size. The only thing is that, for me, these may not be for general wear. They don't breathe at all (since they are waterproof) and can get a little sweaty and uncomfortable if you are indoors for a while. Driving with these shoes has been a little difficult because there is less leeway for the ankle to move, or rather, it takes some getting used to. I am thinking I should have really bought the ""Low WP"" version.",__label__2
"Hi-tec Hiking Boots: Like them. Very lite and comfortable. Dry. I'm a now-and-then day-hiker and had only worn them once in the woods. There was a problem of soreness under the top, inside gromets on both boots.

Suggest including some alternative stringing techniques in shoe boxes.",__label__2
"What a great boot!: This is the second pair of Altitude IV boots for me and I can't imagine a better hiking boot for my purposes. I hike hilly, wooded areas daily and wear these boots throughout the year. My previous pair lasted three years and the only problem is the lining of the heel wore out. They are now my work boots.They look good and lace up well. Break in is immediate. I don't walk in rivers, but waterproofing lasted a year before needing treatment. Their lightweight and durability amaze me. The only thing that concerns me is that Hi-Tec might stop making them by the time I need another pair.",__label__2
"Great Boots!: Bought these boots to replace a pair of New Balance boots at twice the price that didn't hold up. These boots are easily more comfortable and are better built. Even though my current pair are still in great shape, I'm tempted to buy another pair in case they become discontinued.",__label__2
Hi Tec Altitude 4 mens boot: Comfortable boots that are indeed water proof and actually do breathe. They seem to work well for the winter wearing anything from cotton socks to solar socks depending on the outside temperatures. It should be noted that they do not have a slip resistance sole so they can be slippery on smooth wet surfaces. I haven't had a chance to use them in warmer weather to see fully how well they breathe. For the price they are a very good buy.,__label__2
"Yes, they are waterproof!: My work takes me out in bad weather frequently, and I really need a boot that will keep my feet dry. I have suffered through 3 different pairs of ""waterproof"" boots that gave me no protection--you get what you pay for, I guess. Someone suggested I order from L. L. Bean, and I was getting ready to fork up the dough, when I saw these in an e-mail from Amazon. They are not fancy, but they ARE waterproof! And, after an initial breaking-in period, they are quite comfortable. I am thoroughly satisfied with these boots.",__label__2
"Good backpacking boot - for a while: I tried on several more expensive backpacking boots before settling on this one. I have high arches and this boot fit and felt the best. I've put 70-80 miles of backpacking on the boot, including some hard, heavy miles. So far the boot is holding up fine. And they feel great - like I'm walking on cushions.The only downside so far is the leather has worn more quickly than I expected and the waterproofing seems to be wearing off - even after an additional waterproofing treatment.Update:My left boot stopped being supportive after about 90 miles of mid-weight backpacking (with 30-40 lbs). These boots are probably just not durable enough to rely on for backpacking.",__label__2
"Hi-Tech: This is an excellent light-medium weight boot. I wanted to find a reasonably priced hiking boot for weekend trips. This boot meets all of my expectations. It is light but sturdy, waterproof but still ""breathes"" and it fits according to the size listed. This is not a heavy boot for large pack trips but should be more than enough for light trips.The seller delivered as promised and gave link for tracking. I would defintiely buy from this seller again.",__label__2
"Great hiking boots: Pros:- Light weight. I am used to military grade boots and this feels like I am walking bare feet. And it doesn't look it in the pictures- Arrests the ankles and keeps them for twisting- Comfortable soul. 5hr hike over rough terrain easily- Does not oven roast my feetCons:- I would have loved to see some stitching going around the shoe. I know glue has come a long way, but I still don't trust a glue only shoe. So I brought mine in to have it stitched. Sorry Hi-Tec I won't be buying another one in the next 3 yrs.",__label__2
Very happy: So far I'm very happy with my boots.They fit well and seem very well constructed.Time wiill tell how they perform but so far so good.,__label__2
"Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking Boot: Delivery time was excellent. The comments others have made about the boot running narrow are correct. I ordered a wide but while the boot fits ok it does feel tight in the width. The first couple of times I wore it on short hikes it was comfortable, but on a 3 hour hike it rubbed off the skin on the side of my left heel. Also, the boots have a very stiff sole. However, walking in wet snow the boot remained perfectly dry. I'm new to hiking so perhaps this is normal, but the boot leaves something to be desired as far as foot comfort goes.",__label__2
reboot: Great boots. Never had better. Hold up well and definitely keep the water out. Nice and warm in the New England winters. Highly recommend these boots.,__label__2
"Hi-Tec Boots Altitude IV: This is my 2nd pair. This pair was stiff and needed some break in, but feel great now.Would recommend",__label__2
"Excellent boot: This is the boot I've been buying for general purpose for 10 years. An excellent boot - wide enough for my wide feet - fit well right out of the box - leather is tough enough to last many years and out sole is very close to being a 'mountain' out sole. Good support, good shank, good cushion. this my boot of choice of work and light hiking.",__label__2
"Excellent Mid-range Boot!: I just now purchased on Amazon my third pair of Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Boots (over the course of 10 years). I live in Minnesota and have found these boots to be excellent in all types of weather, year-around. In addition to wearing these boots every workday on my warehouse job, I do a lot of weekend hiking, camping and exploring of the North Woods and have never been disappointed with these boot's performance. When worn (and sized) for a good pair of extra cushioned wool socks (I buy Smartwool Trekkers Series), these boots are warm enough for shoveling snow and are also comfortable and cool enough for summer wear. It is a perfect light, all around utility boot and I highly recommend them. They are the only boots I have ever literally worn out (they never failed due to workmanship or materials). I just replace the shoestrings with a good quality boot lace and they ""keep on running""!!",__label__2
"Excelentes botas.. excelentes boots: Excelente producto, quedo muy satisfecho con el producto y con Amazon, por la puntualidad en la entrega,la calidad del producto, zapatos muy comodos, resistentes. Excelente muy recomendable.",__label__2
"Big Improvement After 30 Years!: I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks.",__label__2
"14 YEARS OF LOVING THIS STYLE: My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued.",__label__2
Hi-Tec Boots Work for Me: Had an older pair that lasted for about 6 years. I loved them and sought to replace them with the same model. I got them and they broke in pretty quick. I am happy!,__label__2
Great Boot: These Hi-Tec Boots are excellent and very good quality.I use them while I am a rural carrier. they are a great work boot.I recomend to all. Peter.,__label__2
not good: 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it,__label__1
Cheap Boots: Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots.,__label__1
"VERY NARROW: This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast",__label__1
"hiking boot: We bought these for my husband. He has a rough time with shoes of any kind. These needed some time to be broke in but beyond that are very good. Good price - good value for the money, we think.",__label__2
"Horrible: Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear.",__label__1
Not As durable as i hoped: Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price. I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction. I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time.,__label__1
Good: This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. These boots have a good arch and seem sturdy. They do look a little cheaper than I anticipated. The tread is great. Size runs true.,__label__2
"Boots: I have an old pair and they are great in the winter and comfortable. SoooooI ordered a second pair for this winter and by the looks at the snow fall yesterday, it was a good choice.",__label__2
Hi-Tec are the best shoes: This is my second pair. First pair I wore until the soles were paper thin. Still use them about the yard. Second pair was deliverd quick. Fantastic waterproof feature and comfortable. I occasionally spray shoes to keep them in top notch condition. I high recommend these boots. They are perfect also for hikes as I have wore mine on the AT everytime I visit.,__label__2
"hi-tec mens altitude IV: great boots even works great while walking up wet boards!!! buy this product you will not be sorry, well made and true to size.",__label__2
"Heavy and Stiff: I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction.",__label__1

This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require ""attitude."" In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien.

"Shows fans are starving for Kate Bush recognition: I am a big fan of Kate Bush. I have collected all of her music, including her cameo appearances on other groups; yet I cannot agree with the other reviewers regarding this CD.The only good thing about this album is that most of the artists did indeed attempt to render original, different versions of Kate Bush's wonderful songs. However, I find their talent a little limited.Listening to this album made me a little sad, as it made me wish that a real tribute album to Kate Bush were released, with versions by artists such as Peter Gabriel, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Tori Amos, etc...The fact that this album was highly rated by other reviewers shows how desperate fans are for more recognition of the talent, uniqueness, and influential nature of Kate Bush's music (especially on some rather popular female artists that followed her).",__label__1
"What a lovely treat!: Quite frankly, I'm suprised that no one has ever done a Kate Bush tribute album. Given her cult following and ecclectic catalogue, and the number of recording artist who cite Kate as a major influence, it's an project that's more than a little overdue. And Tom Dunning rises gloriously to the occasion. Clearly everyone involved in this album considers this a labor of love, and it makes for a delightful listen.Some of my favorite tracks? ""There Goes a Tenner"" is rendered in trippy-hippy-hoppy-happy fashion - clever and fun. ""Hounds of Love"" is just lovely to listen to, perhaps even better than la Kate's version. Those who chose to cover the B-sides have my devotion, as those are among my own personal favorites. And the tracks I didn't love, well, I didn't love 'em to begin with.Simply put, if you're a fan of Kate, you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection - and if you're trying to introduce any of your friends to la Kate, this album could only aid you in your cause.",__label__2
"""Desperately seeking..Kate"": Well at first when I purchased this album I was so full of hope, curiosity and impatience, because I admit I am starving for some new work of Kate Bush--hint, hint)and I know I am not alone on this one. Anyhow, I listened to it again, and again, and I realized that this is unfortunately not it. I really liked the remake of ""Suspended in Gaffa"" that was my favorite, very original (that's why the record is not 1 star), but then I quickly skipped to listen to the classic ""Running up that hill"" and...I cried, I am sorry but the remake was well below average. I agree with another reviewer who expressed the wish of having high profile artists performing Kate's awesome art, I am surprised why they haven't done it so far...However no offense to the artists who did take up on the challenge of performing Kate's songs, more power to them, however I wish they came up with something better.",__label__1
"An Excellent Look Into What Motivates Students Of Ballet.: This is a very new ballet documentary with many interviews of students and parents on the joys and sacrifices of dancing ballet. There are many fine scenes of dance routines and the technical proficiency of these dancers is very impressive, indeed. Such is the state of ballet in the 21st century! Several aspects are covered, such as training, family support(or the lack of it), competition, injuries, and eating disorders. This is certainly long enough(almost two hours), but my only criticism is that in many of the interviews we see the person seated in a chair for almost the entire segment, instead of having them talk over scenes of dancing. As a ballet dancer myself, when people start to talk about dancing, I want to see dancing while I listen to them(or else I feel the need to get up and dance myself!). There certainly should have been enough of available footage for this. As it is, it is still an excellent, American look at ballet.",__label__2

Great movie: I think this is a lost David Lean treasure and it is one of Mitchum's finest works. He was a really good actor and I am glad this movie is showing up again and getting good reviews. I think the academa award going to John Mills was a BIG mistake his performance does not hold up over the years. There is a fun book you should get that explains all the complications that went on with the making of this movie that should be included with the DVD,__label__2
"Great Movies: I had last seen this movie when it came out in 1970. The plot, scenery, acting are as good as it gets. John Mills' performance as Michael earned him a well deserved academy award. He had to spend hours every day just on make-up.As time goes by people pass but their art stays with us forever. Most of the actors in Ryans Daughter are long gone. This movie that was initially not a critical favorite has stood the test of time and is in my top ten along with such movies as Kelly's Heroes, The Graduate and so on. Watching it on VHS format didn't diminish a thing.",__label__2
Ryan's Daughter DVD: We were disappointed that this DVD would not play on our regular DVD player. We were able to play it on our computer. There must be something different about the format. Jim Jones,__label__1
"Ryan's Daughter: I loved the movie 40 years ago and I love it just as much now. A recent trip to Ireland made it even more moving. The openingscene of the Cliffs of Moher was just as beautiful as when I saw it on my trip. Much of the dialog about the ""troubles"" in Ireland went over my head when I saw the movie as a young women, hovever they made a real an impression this time. Christopher Jones is still great to look at. Recommend it highly.",__label__2
"One of my favorite movies of all time.: While this movie was not ""highly acclaimed"" when it was released, back in the late 1960's or early 70's ""I think,"" I have always like it and watch it about once every two or three years. It is the kind of movie that you never get ""fully bored with.""On a scale of 1-5 stars, I give it only four (4) stars, since it is one of those movies that many ""action junkies"" would not like; even-though, it actually has quite a bit of ""lower key action"" and beautiful phototgraphy to support it.My bottom line is: ""If you liked Dr. Zhivago then you will, or should, like Ryan's Daughter.""",__label__2
BEAUTIFUL: THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILMS I EVER SAW. VISUALY STUNNING. IF YOUR A FAN OF GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY DO NOT MISS OUT!!!!!!!!! THIS FILM WON THE OSCAR IN THAT CATEGORY FOR BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY IN 1970.,__label__2
"Where Is The DVD?: How can such a beautifully filmed movie directed by David Lean not yet be available on DVD? The superior quality of DVD over video tape would lift this film to the level of how it played on the big screen when first released. The storms, the Irish coast and just about every other scene filmed would look so much better on DVD. John Mills gave his finest performance in this movie and won a deserved Oscar.It would be a fitting epitaph to his memory if the film distributors reissued Ryans Daughter in DVD. Nearly all of David Leans other films are available in DVD format. Why not this epic film?",__label__2
"When oh when!: Each month I scan the ""new"" issues to see if the studio has issued this first rate movie onto DVD but to no avail! when one sees the amount of rubbishy films now being re-issued, it really makes me angry, I guess the reason being the fact that Ryans Daughter was panned in the States, but hay Yanks, how about we Brits? the film was well received over here and is still regulary screened on TV. Freddy Jone's photography should be reason enough but add Sarah Miles, Bob Mitchum, John Mills, where is the problem?",__label__2
"FOR THE SERIOUS COLLECTOR: Beginning with ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in 1957, the only David Lean film I would rate less than 5 stars is ""A Passage to India"" and I would give it 4.8. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is simply one of those films that any serious creator of a DVD library should have on his/her top 25 list. It is so spectacular that, for the life of me, I can't imagine what has taken so long for it to arrive in DVD format. As with all his films, Lean's cinematography is truly unequalled, but there isn't a single ingredient with which one can find reasonable fault. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is what filmmaking should always be and so rarely is.",__label__2

"ROMANCE SET IN NORTHERN IRELAND: Ryan's Daughter (Two-Disc Special Edition)David Lean's very interesting romance set in Northern Ireland in 1916. Robert Mitchum is almost type-cast as the sleepy-eyed and plodding village school - master, who marries young Sarah Miles. Christopher Jones is the British Officer who has an affair with Sarah during his stay in the village. But there are only two real stars of the show - the beautiful, sweeping scenery and John Mills, who won a supporting actor Academy Award, for his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal as the hunch - backed village idiot. Production designer, Stephen Grimes, obviously inspired by David Lean's extravagance, creates an entire village to use as the main set. Trevor Howard and Australian, Leo McKern are also very good in their roles.",__label__2

Good: I originally saw this movie on TV back in the late 1970s. I like the cinematography and of course the acting is superb. However I think the beginning and intermission could have cut out where all you get is about 10-15 minutes of orchestra music with a still picture of Ireland's countryside. Especially at the end of disc 1 where the music goes non-stop and then you realized that the movie continues on disc 2.,__label__2
"Compelling and haunting: This should have been a classic. I saw it originally in the 70s and decided recently to rent it...I wanted to know if it had the same appeal.....if anything, it was far more beautiful than memory served. the scenery is spectacular, the acting suberb! They don't make movies like this anymore! Pour yourself a nice glass of wine and settle down to a very entertaining movie.",__label__2
"Lean Pickin's: Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless.",__label__1

For the price, you can't beat this deal. The picture quality is a whole lot better than what I expected. This is my 4th Samsung purchase and everyone so far has been a very positive experience. I wish this camcorder has some ""advanced features"" like USB connectivity so that I can download movie clips to a computer. But then again, I didn't have the extra [money] to spend. In couple years, I plan to buy a digital camcorder but for now this will suffice.Bottom line:For 1st time buyers, this is a good start. It's not the best camcorder but definately a good one. It's worth the money.",__label__2

"Not worth it!: This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!",__label__1

"This is definitely a ""MUST HAVE"" in your collection...: Two things alone on this album from Jason Robert Brown are all you need to be satisfied with the purchase.1) Track #3- ""Someone to Fall Back On"" is one of my all-time favorites of his. It has such a catchy, but soothing, melody line that can't be passed over.2) Lilias White bustin' it out once again on ""Coming Together"" -- adding a glorious rich sound that fans of her will love to play again and again.Few composers/storytellers can tap in to emotion with such satisfying melodies as this gifted musician. Anything he records will gladly be added to my iTunes b/c I can't get enough. Truly wonderful.",__label__2
"You MUST buy everything by Jason Robert Brown!!!: So hello. This is Grant, a performer and music lover. I've followed Jason's music from the big stuff that everyone knows to the little shows like Urban Cowboy in Coconut Grove that not everyone got to see. This CD is a MUST have. Jason's excellence and genius shines through with such variety in this newly released CD. His adaptability is shown best in Parade, and his fantastic ability to write songs for starving singers comes through in The Last Five Years and Songs For A New World, but if you just want a great CD to listen to with fantastic variety and all around genius, this is the CD to get. This would make a great gift for any open music lover. Don't forget to keep up on his new works. He's a busy guy and is often coming out with new original music. Also look out for his new website!",__label__2
"U need this JRB CD!: This compiliation of songs from gifted, Tony award winning composer Jason Robert Brown is a feast for the ears. For JRB fans, it is a chance to hear his signature style music and witty lyrics up-close and personal, without the constraints of a musical's plot. For newcomers to Mr. Brown's music, you'll get a taste of everything, from the gospel sound of ""Coming Together"" to the big band swing of ""Grow Old With Me"" to the spirited rock/musical sound of ""Getting Out"". My favorite is the ballad ""Someone to Fall Back On"", which he often uses as an encore at his live performances. The energy in the band and vocals captures the feel those live performances . This is a 'must-have' CD!",__label__2
"Another Aw Inspiring Career Move: Just when you thought JRB couldn't get better he does. The music is greatly appealing to a wide range of listeners. Of course if your a fan you already have it. If you are not familiar there is something for everyone. It isn't the stereotypical musical theatre album. It has a wonderful rock/pop feel with musical theatre sensibility as only JRB can seem to produce.One of my favorites is Over. A tremendous song about a soldier who just died in the desert of some war torn country (just pick one). It is touching, poignant, and somehow even patriotic.So anyway run to get this album because it will be a classic and if you are not into musical theatre it is because you haven't heard it executed like this.",__label__2

"really good release of the ORIGINAL 1957 LP!: I think too many people are assuming that they are buying a compilation CD when they pick up this release. In fact, this was the original album released in 1957. Ella gets top billing becuse she was the biggest of the three ""names"" at the time. These sessions were laid down between Jan 4, 1956 and April 30, 1957. Each artist gets a chance to showcase their talents and it is apparent that, when they all get together for the few numbers that they all share, they are really swinging and having a great time. Basie's band was in top form, the arrangements were wonderful and the vocals are spot on. This is a terrific window into the past.",__label__2
"Great Fidelity 1956 1957 Swing From Basie and Williams.: What we have here is the crack ""April In Paris"" era Basie band with one Ella F track singing with Joe Williams on ""Too Close To Comfort"", a bunch of tracks with Joe taking the lead and a few great swinging instrumentals and a few alternative sides.The whole album works well, great sound,exciting music,especially if you like the croon of Joe Williams.The famous ""Joe Williams sings CD"" with Basie is considered the better,no arguing that fact, but this CD is a nice addition to your library.Great blowing on the 3 versions of One'O'clock Jump here make it all worthwhile.",__label__2
"Good print quality - bad mechanism: I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one.",__label__1
"Lousy: This has to be the most horrible printer in the world. If I could give it -5 stars I would. I just got a new digital camera and of course just got this printer. Now when I print my photos it has blurred lines through it and is all messed up. Its print quality is horrible. It may be a bad printer - but HP is no help at all. They keep saying to install new drivers, when it is clearly a hardware problem. I want to throw this thing away, unfortunatly I got it on clearance and I'm stuck with it. Don't buy this pile of junk.",__label__1
Older Craftsman Garage Door Opener.: I have an older Craftsman Garage Door Opener. Had replaced the gears to my garage door opener and it would not work right. Would only move a foot or so and stop. Looked up information about what could possibly be wrong and it suggested that the RPM Sensor Assembly probably needed replaced. Replaced it and it now works like a charm. Was much cheaper then buying a whole new automatic garage door opener.,__label__2
Got 'er fixed: This was one of the most simple and cost saving things I have done. instructions were exact and took longer to put cover back on vs. change the part.,__label__2
Product Performance: RPM sensor was defective. The lift motor would not stop running with the new circuit board installed.I removed the new circuit board and replaced it with the old one and everything seems to be OK now.The part is so inexpensive it's not worth returning.,__label__1
Worked like a charm: My garage door was not working for 4 months.And did some research and bought this product.Right away the garage door started working great.,__label__2
RPM Sensor Assembly: Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast,__label__2
Customer service: The item is excellent and that was exspected and it resolved the issue. But the seller is very customer focused. Thanks,__label__2
"Best Computer Acessory: A year and a half ago, I purchased everything I needed for my first computer. I did a lot of research and went way wrong with highly recommended Dell computer. But, based on what I could see at the store (the clerks at CompUSA are not too eager to help) I bought this printer. It has been the best purchase of my computing experience. Photos are flawless, as is everything else I print with this printer. It seeems to do what it is supposed to and musch more incredibly well.",__label__2
"Fantastic Photo Printer: This has been a great printer for me. I regularly print both 4x6 and letter size photos. The quality is outstanding, and the automatic paper sensor is a good feature. I had absolutely no problems with set up. The only improvement would be to print borderless.",__label__2
"Envelope Feeder Never Worked: I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one.",__label__1
"My mistake: This printer has been a nightmare. First I can not usemy Visioneer scanner. They say it is not compatable.I removed a jammed paper, and since then anything I print,such as invoices, checks and such, come out with blotchedprinting and paper tears. I get NO help from technicalsupport(They're learning). No 800 number, which means youhave to call CA on your buck.I used to swear by HP. Now I am convinced that theirproducts are close to junk. My opinion is STAY AWAY!",__label__1
"Poor customer support: The printer worked fine for about a year (no borderless prints though). After 15 months it started jamming every single time that I tried to print. I expected a ... repair bill (replace the roller) since the printer is out of warranty. According to HP, no 1215 printer can be repaired. Their only option is an exchange. They will send you a new HP 1215 for [price] (retail is [price]) and you return your old one. Apart from a ... coupon this is the ONLY option. Buyer beware.",__label__1
"Recipe for grief: Until this product, I was a huge promoter of HP printers, but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility. Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX. I'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they don't work and/or freeze up my entire computer. Because of this printer I've cleaned off my entire hard drive, lost valuable files and programs, and still wound up with a non-functional machine. It's been in my closet for 6 months, and I'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer.",__label__1
"Hate This Printer! Annoying messages to reset it !!!: I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the ""arms"" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the ""yellow box marked !"" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!",__label__1

"Worth the wait: This album is worth the wait. Great vocals accompanied by rocking fuzzed out riffs. Sounds like the perfect cross between Unida and Kyuss. The cd hasn't left my player yet. The only problem I have (which means 4 stars instead of 5) is that its fairly short. It really only has 7 tracks that total under 30 minutes. That aside, any fan of this genre of music will love it. The cd flat out rocks all the way through.",__label__2
"Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars: This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me.",__label__1
"Can't Believe This Was Even Published: Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book"".",__label__1
"This player deserves more US air time: I fell in love with Brasilian jazz my first trip to Rio. I've been there many times and was always amazed, visiting the little clubs, listening to a lot of great players. I don't remember how I found this guy, but, understanding music 'from the heart', Leo understands, and plays it that way. In my view, he is one of the most sensitive sax players I've ever heard - check out #3 on Black Pearls, you'll see what I mean..... I think it would be a great project for Leo to hook up with Bob James and Fourplay, and let Leo play, I mean feature him, write and produce songs that bring out his talent, give him lots of freedom. I rated this 4 stars, simply because of a couple of songs I skip pver, but all in all, it's great listening. And as a bassplayer, I've spent hours playing along with him.",__label__2

"too small to read: My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-(",__label__1
A classic favorite.: Paul Galdone captures the story just right with his wording and illustrations. This is a must-have for my grandchildren. You can't go wrong with a Paul Galdone illustrated folktale.,__label__2
"A short story....: A wonderful story but somewhat short. Take out the illustrations and the total story would be two or three pages long. But I love some of the old tales and I love cats, so this was a must for my library. The Puss In Boots reminds me of the tricksters of Native American tales. Enjoy!",__label__2
"A well earned Caldecott: Puss in boots is always an enjoyable tale, probably because it is so based on wit.I really enjoyed these illustrations they are glowing and friendly, making one feel very comfortable as they turn the pages. Puss is adorable, the expressions that our fine illustrator manages to convey through his feline features are just fantastic! Time and time again I was always dissapointed when I found a page that the lovely cat was not on.A wonderful additition to any collection of books for children or lover of fairy tales.",__label__2

"Boring: Gorecki, as usual, is striving for profound angst, but for the most part this Quartet just comes across as boring. The second and fifth movements are terrible. The first movement develops some tense themes that Gorecki could have explored further, but he drops them midway to revert back to his usual droning. The third and fourth movements are the only ones with character, with the latter developing a decent amount of bittersweet sadness.",__label__1
"Deceptively good: Just to be clear: the album is uniformly quiet and just consists of electric guitar without lots of special effects except long sustain. The genius of the record is that MazzaCane can bring out so much with minute details -- muffled string noises, minute pitch changes, perfect arhythmic timing of notes. Don't mistake apparent simplicity for emptiness, as another reviewer did. One of the most moving records I've heard, with a rare, sad, clear quality. I'd recommend this as a first album by this artist (he calls it his best too).",__label__2
"There's nothing in the Airs: The samples sounded interesting, but a few spins revealed that there's really nothing of substance here. While I'll concede Connors sounds like a proficient guitarist, he's just not really playing anything here. The Airs pass by like a breeze, leaving nothing memorable behind. It is not substantial enough to be either good or bad.",__label__1
A well written and thought out book on Risk Management: This book provides practical and insightful look at risk management and how it can benefit companies. Reading and understanding this book should be a pre-requisite for any person going to take on management position.,__label__2
"A Must Read for Risk Management: This book is not only about the theory of enterprise risk management, but also a summary of the author¡s experience in practicing risk management for more than twenty years. And what is more, there are several case studies that are deeply analyzed in the book. It is because of this that I think it is an excellent work on enterprise risk management. In addition, it is interesting that the Balance of the Yin and Yang in the Chinese traditional philosophy is applied as Lesson 7 by the author. It is a must read for all business managers and students who want to pursue a career in risk management.",__label__2
"Fables from India Well Presented.: Pancatantra the ancient book of fables, is an interesting collection of animal stories composed in India around the third century of the Christian era. It has been one of the first Indian classics to be translated into the western languages. Therefore these fables with their relevance to political, moral and religious life have become widely known and acclaimed. Patrick Olivelle the chair of the department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, equipped with necessary expertise and familiarity with the subject matter and language, has translated these fables and rendered them in plain everyday language, though with all their complexities, for the sake of the American readers. The very informative introduction and extensive explanatory notes make the text fairly simple and easy to understand and relish. For those interested in the Indian classics, this storybook is a wonderful gift.",__label__2
Good translation.: This is an eminently readable translation though I still prefer Arthur W. Ryder's translation. I believe Ryder's translation is currently out of print.,__label__2
"Great Update of, and Supplement to, Strunk & White: Similar in style and tone (and usefulness) to Strunk & White's classic ""Elements of Style"". Short, pithy, intelligent.

There are six sections:Elementary Principles of Literary ConstructionConventions Governing Punctuation, Capitalization, Typography, and FootnotesCharacteristics of Bad WritingWords Often MisusedWords Often MispronouncedProofreaders' MarksApparently Lasch's frustration with students went beyond just their writing skills. ""I keep simplifying my course in 20th century American history, but the students keep getting dumber faster than I can simplify it,"" Lasch wrote in a letter to his father. ""Every year the illiteracy gets worse.""The current book was published after the author's death and includes an introduction by Stewart Weaver. The introduction is disproportionately long, taking up 42 of 121 pages.",__label__2
"I appreciate what he attempted, but...: I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds. It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues. Perhaps to someone researching Lasch himself (who was, admittedly, a renown academic) this material would be interesting, but it isn't in the context of language reference.",__label__1

"Summer classic: It's been a good year for Liverpool's The Coral. A mere number of months after their stunning debut comes this, surely one of the singles of the year. ""Pass It On"" is their state of the universe address, a plaintive plea for understanding. It begins a little like The Beatles' ""You Like Me Too Much"" but soon becomes its own thing of beauty. Far more low-key than anything on The Coral, they seem to have dispensed that elemental quirkiness which so defined their earlier work. Frontman James Skelly is the real star of this track, his magnificent vocals squarely front and center. Anticipating their forthcoming Magic & Medicine album, ""Pass It On"" is a summer track for the ages and The Coral have done it again. Was there ever any doubt?",__label__2
hard to find - but worth it: A progammable thermostat that you can actually set differently for each of the seven days - perfect for people with non traditional schedules. And the 'off the wall' setting capability makes it very convenient to set up.,__label__2
"Get rid of cycling: I was sick of the constant cycling my cheap programmable thermostat was doing. It would cycle my furnace and A/C every 5 to 10 minutes regardless if it needed it. This one let's you adjust that cycle temperature. I adjusted it so now it can have up to +/-2.5 degree F swing. So if you set 65 it will kick on at 63 and shut off at 67. It can be adjusted so it stays at a constant temperature as well, but I was trying to get rid of the constant cycling during cold weather. Great product so far.",__label__2

"Excellent book to guide women through the divorce process: This is a thoughtfully-written book by two experts that answers all the questions divorcing women should be asking themselves, from whether to hire a lawyer or mediator to how to manage money and a household after the divorce. Written by women for women, it describes what to expect at every stage of divorce and includes very specific information on how and where to get additional help and support. I would definitely give this book to a friend who was contemplating or going through a divorce.",__label__2
"Irrelevant for some state & women: I found this book almost entirely irrelevant and in sore need of update. Nowadays, many states have ""no fault"" divorce (e.g., Colorado), the men's movement has changed culture, and MANY women are career women who are the main bread-winners of the family. This book takes NONE of that effectively into account. Therefore, the book was a total waste of money and time for me. I do not recommend it for any career woman and dedicated mother who is the bread-winner and in a position to need to pay maintenance, lose significant assets, AND lose parenting time despite being BOTH primary parent and primary breadwinner. This book needs to catch up with the times.",__label__1
What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce and Custody:: This book was a god send. It helped me with so many issues. I found it to be a true survival guide with advice that works. I purchased the book months ago when I was first separated. Now my ordeal is almost over but I still keep the book by my nightstand and refer to it constantly.,__label__2
"only about custody!: This book should be titled 'What Every Woman Should Know about Custody Battles'. I found absolutely nothing helpful about a basic childless divorce in this book. If you are going through a divorce and have custody issues, this might be okay for you. If you have no children, don't even bother.",__label__1
"Awful: I bought this book for a friend going through a divorce, luckily I read it first. In a section about a father not being involved with his children they accuse the mother of not making him feel welcome, in a section about court they advise women not to wear short shirts or make-up and it only gets worse. This book was written to convince women to stay married so they don't loss their children.",__label__1
"What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce And Cusody: This is the most thorough and informative book on divorce issues that I have read. As a divorce attorney, I am always curious to know what other attorneys are thinking. Ms. Smith's perspective and commentary mirror much of my own experiences and conclusions. The book is easy to read and filled with relevant, realistic examples and practical advice. I highly recommend this book to both nonlawyers, who have a reason to learn about this subject and to lawyers so they can refine and expand their knowedge of the divorce process.",__label__2
"This book is a real roadmap, precise and thorough: This book is an indispensable tool for any woman who is facing (or contemplating) a divorce with custody issues and who doesn't know how to even begin the process. It's a ""comfort"" book in the sense that it is precise and reassuring--almost a roadmap to follow-- especially when life seems out of control. This manual is a great resource to share with friends.",__label__2
"From a Man's Perspective: I am soon to be beginning the process. I will be initiating it. I read this book to gain insite into a woman's perspective and possible strategies.I guess if you haven't read or learned much, this book can have some tremendous value. If you're somewhat knowledgeable about the process, it is good, but not the end all.One thing to remember, only 1-2% of all divorce cases are tried in court. Yes, judges approve them, but the real work is with the lawyers.It's clearly worth it price.",__label__2
"What a pity: What a pity that a book about a part of India that has received little attention turns out to be so poorly written. A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this."" The author comes across as a naive young woman who did not even know to take toilet paper to a remote part of India and patently she (and her travelling companions) had done little (if any) reading about the history and politics of Assam. This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book.",__label__1
"Great coverage...lousy quality: The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version.

"Don't waste your time: I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate.

"You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs...: Chumbawamba is an underground British band that has been around for almost 20 years. They had a stroke of surprising luck in 1997 with the infectious dance/sports anthem Tubthumper. However, that song is not a good representation of their sound. Musically they remind somewhat of Scissors Sisters with a little Frankie Goes to Hollywood or maybe a rebellious Abba with a few shots of whiskey in them. Their lyrics are very political in a very abstract way and written for a British audience at that. The CD is also filled with many anarchist spoken-word soundbites. I checked out their very active website and they are selling t-shirts with George Bush's face above the label TERRORIST and the back of the shirt says ""You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs"". Even Tubthumper is about ""shouting to change the world, then having a drink to celebrate"".",__label__2
"From the land of Tellytubbies...: Despite their pretentious, anarchist pose, these guys CAN knock out a blooody goood toon. The title song and the intro to ""Amnesia"" merit special mention but the entire work is strewn with lively and colorful bursts of sound. Give them an ""A"" too for originality and their monster drummer. Less gratifying, but still interesting, are the snippets of dialogue lifted from British television and their mixing of curious psychological and political fantasies. Thumbs down on the silly ""Creepy Crawling"", ""Mary, Mary"" and the obnoxious Jude Abbott.",__label__2

Buy some other album from those nice people at amazon: With no harmful intentions toward the movie brassed off.(thats where the talk at the begining of the song tubthumpin came from)Thank God I don't have any guns. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this review. What is this bait and switch. I first heard tubthumping on the radio very most excellent. Or so I thought. I bought the CD hoping for some good British tunes and what did i get. Stuff the baby on the cover could have written better. Please save shelve space never make another CD in this genre.,__label__1
"Skanky lightning in a bottle: I have heard many CD's in my day, and none have irritated me as much as this CD. They spout of phrases of anarchy and rebellion while doing the talk show circuit promoting this piece of crap. They seem to be the worst kind of hypocrites, ones with a bad sense of humor. Tumpthumping looses it appeal the second your hangover sets in and manages to sit in your head for the rest of the day. It seems destined to become a staple in the yuppie dance floors of the future. After sitting through the full 45 minutes or so of the Chumbawumba exprience, I reversed my stance on euthenasia. Stay away, fa r away.

"Disappointed: I purchased this printer with high expectations. But was very disappointed. Right off, I had problems with paper jamming and printer errors. I even think it jammed so much that a small piece broke off. When it prints the quality is great but I have had a lot of trouble with it when trying to print on card stock. It doesn't appear to be very sturdy and makes me very nervous every time I try to print more than a few sheets at a time. Even regular bond paper has a tendency to jam if printing more than a couple sheets at a time. I've always thought HP printers were the way to go, but after this one, I don't know if I'll buy another HP.",__label__1

I just hope HP can make the installation process simpler.Color prints on glossy are not bad but don't expect them to look exactly like real photographs. Either I bought the wrong model for ""film camera quality"" pictures or ink printers just aren't up to par yet. ...",__label__2
"Not recommended: We have had this printer about 3 weeks and the cartridge already needs replaced. We do not do an excessive amount of printing, so I think that is a little too soon to run out of ink.Also this printer jams up very easily (one of the reasons I was replacing the last HP printer I had) I feel I have spent as much time fixing paper jams as I have printing. It is easy to fix when it does jam up, but a little frustrating that it happens so often.The print quality is good (just make sure you have the paper settings set correctly to the type of paper you are using!) and it does print quietly and is easy to operate. But overall I would not recommend it.",__label__1
"If you value your time and money then I'd something else...: I have owned an HP 940c now for about a year, and as it's now 4AM in the morning and I have a long project to work on, the printer has given me a hardware failure.Having said that I've tried it on different computers, with different cartridges (thought maybe the OS X driver was to blame but evidently not), and it's dead. Now it's 4AM and I've spent 2 hours troubleshooting the printer only to have it dead.To top it off this printer uses the HP #15 cartridge which is a #45 cartridge with half the ink at the same price.. you cannot use a #45 in this printer.I highly reccomend against buying this printer. Not only is it subject to the expensive ink cartridges but it has been widely known for paper feeder problems (a school district recalled theirs), and they are all eventually prone to this sort of failure.",__label__1
"Not a very good printer: Lasted six months. Never worked exactly right since I purchased it. I think it had software driver problems. Would work sporadically, then lock up and paper have to be cleared manually. Final straw, no matter what type paper it was fed, it would catch in the feed path underneath the print head for no apparent reason. Of course the paper still keeps trying to feed, so the machine just wads it into a mess. In addition to the software driver problem, I think it has a significant design problem with the paper feed as it often trys to feed up to five or six sheets at once, even the HP desk jet paper designed for such printers. I will say that when it did work, it printed well.",__label__1
"Limited life span: My 940C lasted five years, but ate up its paper drive mechanism yesterday.The prints were very good, although color quality was sometimes off.Hard to complain when it came free with the Mac, but it is a slow printer and with amulti-color ink cartridge, somewhat more expensive than a printer using more individual cartridges.Always had minor paper feeding glitches.",__label__1
NEVER BUY THIS PRINTER!!: I spent over 2 1/2 hrs. (after 1 hr. myself) on the phone with HP trying to install this printer. It never would work right. The HP tech said there is a problem in the software program of this printer. This HP DESKJET 940C is everyone's worst installation nightmare!,__label__1
"Avoid this one!: After returning two malfunctioning HP960c printers due to frequent paper jams, we bought the HP940 hoping it would work better. It was worse. The paper jammed or was shredded every second page. It took a great deal of time to print even one document. We tried the more expensive HP paper and the paper jams continued at the same rate. We were unable to print any envelopes at all due to repeated jamming. It is clear that the paper feeding mechanism is defective in these HP printers.We've had HP printers for years with no problems. We were loyal HP fans; however, we've had to return THREE of their printers in the past few weeks. That's unacceptable. We just returned the HP 940 and bought a Canon S630. So far, no problems with the Canon--a relief!",__label__1
"Don't Go There: Despite the great rating and rave reviews, I curse the day I brought this one home. I have gone through at least a ream of paper in the three weeks I have had this printer--not because I am so productive, but because the paper jams so often and the printer actually shreds the paper as it tries to eject. Several cries for help and complaints to HP customer service resulted in ""that's a common problem. The arm doesn't detract after each page. You will have to manually reset the arm whenever that happens."" So far, that means 6-8 times per day. No more HP for me! This is my second bad experience. You would think I would have learned by now.",__label__1
"Buyer Beware: I decided to get a new printer for picture reproduction and small business projects. The printer shredded 40% of the print jobs I sent. The roller jams the paper in back, forcing you to remove a panel and ripping the sheet from the teeth of this monster. It is like playing toy-tug with my dog. If it does not eat your print jobs, then the sheet is fed in cockeyed and it prints off kilter when a lucky sheet makes it out of this beast. I was very dissapointed after only one week of ownership",__label__1
"Great But?: This is a great printer for any use up to 8X10 photo production. The ""But"" in the review is the cost of ink and the fact that it uses a single cartridge. I run out of one color ink even with it set to a lighter setting in the printing menu and I am out of luck. The rest is wasted. The two sided printing is great ...particuclary with all these programs now having the 'manual' on the CD to print....",__label__1
Very Good printer: I had a very hard time trying to find a printer that I could afford that printed good quality images. I had an Epson 440 printer that wasn't very good with printing photos and it always put streaks of black ink on everything. I went to Staples to buy a new printer after my Epson died on me and was planning on buying the Canon S600 but they were out of stock so I picked up the HP deskjet 940c and was a bit worried after reading the reviews here that I might not have a good printer but so far this printer is great! The first thing I printed on it was an old photo of my grandfather that came out better than the original. I then printed some wallet size pictures of my son from his school picture they also came out wonderful. I am very pleased with this printer. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it seems to be a bit slow in printing but as long as the printing comes out well that doesn't bother me too much. I would definitely recommend this printer.,__label__2
"It worked fine until I bought a new computer: I owned this printer for more than a year. It worked fine until I bought a new computer, I unplugged it, moved to a new place, and replugged it.

"This is progress?: Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer, this ""upgraded"" model is a bomb. Jams, can't print straight, picks up multiple sheets, and horrible service all add up to a misfire. I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me, and both replacements had more problems than the original! I've written off my 940c. I don't think anyone should waste their time (and certainly not their money) on this one.",__label__1

"Bad printer: Do not buy this printer. I have had nothing but trouble with it- it jams every other time I print, and most of the time, it grabs 3-4 papers at once, and prints on all of them. I certainly expected better quality from HP, and this did not deliver. The printing is decent when it works, which is not often. I will be looking for a different company next time.",__label__1
"Extremely unhappy: I hate this printer! It is nothing but problems. Every single time I go to print even a single page, there is some sort of problem! The paper jams, I get timeout errors, the ink runs out too fast and I am unable to fill it with the refill kits. The thing has a mind of it's own and starts spewing out pages even when I'm not trying to print anything. It wouldn't be so bad if it didn't put trash on each page wasting my paper. It's a piece of junk! 1 Star is highly overrating this product!",__label__1
"worked great until it just STOPPED working at all!: I replaced an EPSON about 6 months ago that worked for about 9 months before the paperfeed went out. I thought I was ""movin' up"" by purchasing an HP, well, this one stopped working after 6 months: the printer carriage gets hung up on the right. I went to the website for troubleshooting options, none of which solved the problem....and the warranty is the biggest weakness...90-days! This alone speaks poorly of the expectations HP has of its own products. EPSON's warranty was 1 YEAR, but I had misplaced the receipt. SO, perhaps EPSON is a better deal, as long as you KEEP THE RECEIPT!",__label__1
"Save your money--buy something else.: I bought this printer based on the reputation of HP--not again. I have had it for 5 months and it just stopped working. I went to the web site to get troubleshooting info about the error codes. I have spent an easy 6 hrs working on it and nothing worked. It suggests calling phone support ""if you are still having trouble."" I called phone support but, because I had bought the printer more than 90 days ago, they wanted [money]per phone call--forget that. I email for support and it sent me a computer generated response redirecting me to the same web page I first started with. I am taking the [money] I would have wasted on the phone call just to get someone to read me the same damn web page and then ask me to phone back later and going to try a new brand of printer.

"Beecham as Wagnerian: Thomas Beecham (1879-1961) is not thought of today as a major Wagner conductor, but he did conduct a number of Wagner's music dramas at Covent Garden in the 1930s, and has recorded a number of Wagner overtures and preludes, including this collection.Although the early- mid 1950s sound will be an issue for some, I urge serious collectors to consider this recording, as it shows Beecham's mastery of Wagner. A great alternative to other Wagner collections of Bohm (DG), Karajan (EMI), Furtwangler (Naxos Historical and EMI), Bernstein (Sony) and Ormandy (Sony).Highly recommended.",__label__2

I've used it in coffee and tea and baking and had pretty good results. I've mixed it with stevia as well. I don't detect any bitterness or soapiness, but it has a somewhat minty effect that is hard to describe. The mintiness is not really a flavor so much as a minty coolness. I find the yellow sweetener's flavor to be much more sugary than zsweet, but I wanted a sweetener that does not use maltodextrin as a filler.",__label__2

"What a disappointment: As an avid sci-fi reader, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and read the book that really is a foundation of much of today's sci-fi. When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating. Kudos to Asimov for opening the door for better writers but too bad his work (at least this early work) is terrible. Don't waste your time reading this one. Go straight to the many better post-Asimov authors.",__label__1
"Melodramatic pulp: Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices.

After the second or third time an expected dramatic climax was suddenly resolved by a literal deus ex machina, the thrill was gone. Maybe Asimov was being ironic?? I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein.",__label__1
"Wonderful book, except for the part with all the words.: The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from ""Foundation"" to ""How Not to Write a Book"" or ""Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English."" I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight.",__label__1
"Classic Sci-Fi: I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov's ""Foundation series"" novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but ""Foundation and Empire"" moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development.",__label__2

"Disappointing: I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way.",__label__1

The story of the last years of the Trantor Empire helped me understand a lot about our society. Even though I read it in College I still have Harry Seldon name stock in my mind. Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society. It is a marvelous saga of a loooong story of a new Empire (USA?) build after the fall of an old one (Britain?). More or less this will be a very entertaining textbook on social science of history. A must for a serious SCFI reader.",__label__2
Outstanding Sequel!: This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. :),__label__2
This was the best book that I have ever read!: Foundation is the complete book of adventure. Brilliantly written by Asimov (as usual). This book is a must-read for all readers!,__label__2
Fantastic!: This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;),__label__2
"A sci-fi classic: Foundation is a classic of the Sci-Fi genre, and that is nearly everything you need to know. If you like Sci-Fi, and are willing to put up with some of it's common shortcomings, this book will appeal greatly to you, for it truly deserves its place in the Sci-Fi canon.",__label__2
"zzzzzz.....: I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book.",__label__1
"It's NOT the FIRST book. Prelude to the Foundation is--AND IT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON KINDLE.: The first book in the series is NOT Foundation. It's Prelude to Foundation. It's not available on Kindle. That's why they're lying to you, so you'll buy the one they DO sell.How's this for an idea, AMAZON: Just start selling Prelude to the Foundation on Kindle! Everyone's happy!",__label__2
"Epic? Not hardly. May contain spoilers.: I bought this book because Asimov is supposedly one of the sci-fi greats, but if this book is a good example of his work his reputation is overblown. I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read.",__label__1
"Interesting storyline: I'm not a fan of sci-fiction, but really enjoyed it. I agree with other reviews that environment wasn't deeply described and there weren't any sophisticated characters, but this didn't disturbed me, because the storyline was fast-paced and interesting. I couldn't put this book down before it was over.",__label__2
"Odd, yet unique sci-fi storytelling ...: Despite all the hype and negativity due to popularity backlash none can honestly admit that Asimov made a mundane focus for his writing passions when he wrote and then published the stories that comprise 'Foundation'. Since I read this epic book in eighth grade it has stuck with me due to the relation of structural decay and rebirth in a future universe that mirrors our own rather perochial existance. The serendipity and foresight combining thought and action to build a better future for mankind in the Milky Way galaxy will leave the experienced, educated readers feeling they have witnessed the true future of our reality. This is a truely brilliant effort of science fiction as are many of Asimov's early works. Shame on the nay sayers.",__label__2

"Science Fiction 101: So, you're thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don't know where to start.Start with Asimov's _Foundation_. Simply put, this is where science fiction starts. You will be introduced to the concept of a vast, complex history of a civilization which is certainly not Planet Earth... and, get this, it was written several decades before we sent anyone to the moon.And there's more... Foundation leads to an entire trilogy which leads to another trilogy which, get this, actually leads you back to Planet Earth.Five stars. Possibly more.",__label__2
"Good? You bet. Great? Not sure ...: I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin.",__label__2
"Not A Great Book By Any Means, But Well Written: Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them.",__label__2
"Bor-ring!: I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme.",__label__1
"what masterpiece?: This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now.",__label__1
"This is a cult book...: ... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it. The characters are flat, the story is contrived, and why are all people of power in this world men? Very realistic idea of the future.",__label__1
"The grandfather of SF books: If you're only going to read one SF book, this is the one. This was my introduction to SF many years ago and it's still my all-time favorite. Asimov was the original and is still the master.",__label__2
"The first book of the best series ever. Period.: This book is the perfect kickoff to the greatest and most amazing Science-Fiction series ever. Asimov and his Foundation are the foundation of all modern science fiction. This book especially is a fascinating story full of characters so real you could expect to bump into them on the street, to speak nothing of the Doctor's amazing - and totally beleivable - futuristic technology.If you want to get a transcendental, literary experience or you just want to read a damn fine story, the Foundation series - and especially this book - are what you're looking for.",__label__2

"Didn't Believe a Word of It: I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation.",__label__1
"Foundation: The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars.",__label__1
"One of the worst things I've ever read: This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls. The language is about as colorful as a newspaper.The ideas behind the novel may have been new and interesting 50 years ago, (although anyone familar with Wells, Huxley, or Verne would debate that), but now they are just tired and beaten like a dead horse.",__label__1
"Foundation [is not good]: ...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work.",__label__1
"Give the man SOME credit: Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for ""inaccuracy"" in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels.",__label__2
"Good Book: I really liked this book,especially the fact [SLIGHT SPIOLER] That you get to see different people's perspectives at different periods of time. [END OF SPIOLER] I would reccomend this to anyone who likes books by Isaac Asimov or a story that takes place over a long time. ****",__label__2
"On with the foundation: Unlike the first Foundation book, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended.",__label__2
"Going deeper: I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later.",__label__2
"The Zenith of Asimov!: I highly recommend the time to read ""Foundation""...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!",__label__2
"Reading can seldom be this much fun!: Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation.",__label__2
"Confused about ""classic"" status: Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. ""Nuclear"" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!",__label__1
"Piece of crap from crap seller: I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. What's worse, it's in absolutely terrible shape.

"Well, it's Asimov: This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book.",__label__1
Dry Sci-Fi: I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this.,__label__1
"Ahead Of His Time.: The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time.",__label__2
"THIS ONE IS GREAT BUT DEPENDS UPON YOUR TASTE: I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot, etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste, while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years, there are many, many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories, all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said, it, the book, can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it.",__label__2
"A very well writen, exciting book about a possible future of: This book, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire.

"Great Book for any Age: I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever.",__label__2
"A good lead-in, but the series gets better: (If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed ""Foundation"" and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated ""Foundation"" may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions.",__label__2
"Future and Past of the Human Civilization: a Epic Story: Before ""Foundation"" i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past.",__label__2
Excellent unless you are looking for Star Wars: This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment.,__label__2
"Good novel, but the other books in the series are better.: Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever.",__label__2
"Get this book: Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more.",__label__2
"Excellent stepping stone to world of SF!: Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one.",__label__2
Classic: I hadn't read this since I was a teenager. I had forgotten what an excellent writer and fantastic mind Isaac Asimov was.

I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!",__label__2
"Science Fiction Masterpiece: Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime.",__label__2
"Perhaps the finest sci fi series of all time: In reviewing the book Foundation I am recommending that you read all of the Foundation books by Asimov. Just get started and read them all. Even though each book can be read individually, do yourself a favor and read them in order. I won't be reviewing any other books in the series. I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written.",__label__2

The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution.

"Foundation is a good read for all readers especially scfi fans: Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you.",__label__2

"A very bad book: ...To my surprise and disappointment, I found ""Foundation"" to be an exceptionally terrible ""book"", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged ""novel"" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ...",__label__1
"An Example of What is ""Classically"" Wrong with SciFi.: I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads.

"Still swings after all these years: For an album recorded nearly 1/2 a century ago (December 1956), Swinging Kicks doesn't sound outdated. The sound quality, while not up to today's digital perfection, is still quite listenable. The playing is awesome (lotsa power!), but what do you expect from guys like Maynard, Bud Shank, Ben Webster, etc. According to the liner notes, the tunes come from a film Buddy scored called The Wild Party (unfamiliar to me). Interestingly, some charts have 2 pianos (Andre Previn and Paul Smith). Originally produced by Norman Granz, 40 minutes. By the way, Buddy has a web site up with some interesting remembrances of his Songbook recordings with Ella - check it out.",__label__2

There's not a better example of original West Coast Cool out there. The arrangements are interesting and varied... the section and solo work fabulous. My only (tiny) objection is that I wish there were a few jazz Standards included. But that aside, it's still a wonderful addition to anyone's collection and a MUST HAVE if you're into WCJ. By the way, Buddy has a fairly recent CD out now called ""SWING"". And does it ever! This one is full of old standards re-done in a kickin' modern swing style.

Nicolas Cage's character seems like he would have been extinguished right when he started acting like a nut.In a crime drama, there must be some semblance of reality of which this had none.The ending was terrible in this entertaining yet totally unbelievable movie. Werner Herzog is excellent with man-eating bears, obessessed opera lovers, cool nature flick and POW escape plots but, he was out of his element on this one.",__label__1

However, his acting just couldn't save this rather stupid 2009 film in which he is cast as a drug addicted detective in post-Katrina New Orleans. No doubt he has a complicated life. His girlfriend is a prostitute, his father is a recovering alcoholic and his father's wife likes to drink a whole lot of beer. His world is one of drug addiction and corruption and there's not a single character that is in any sense likable. To top this all off, it is so boring that I fell asleep. Definitely not recommended.",__label__1

"It doth suck.: I found this movie pathetic at times. The drug use and plot line was, at times, absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my $ renting this b/c it just wasn't worth it.

"trying hard but fail to impress: If you want to watch this, the better option is to rent it. It has nothing to do with the original. It stands on its own. Between the coke-takings and the iguanas and the alligators, there's not enough punch to make this film emerges as a great film to be bought and re-watch again in my book. There were a lot of potentials, but the director takes the easy way out with an already thin plot. Nicholas Cage was ok, too bad Fairuza Balk had only 2 scenes. Eva Mendes and Val Kilmer's talents were wasted. Just everage to such a promising start of a might-be-an-awesome film. Just ok, but not memorable at all.",__label__1

"Drowning at midnight: I enjoyed this. Get to see N Cage in a role where he can wallow in his manic phase shtick...a wonderful diversion from typical film normalacy. He starts off living in a nightmare, and somehow dives deeper and deeper into an overwhelming whirlpool of desperation and threat. It all takes place in New Orleans, a city where dissipation is a career. During the lowest part of Cage's crash dive, Herzog includes some bizarre shots of alligators and iguanas. Disconcerting, but an interesting visual evocative of his mindset at the moment. This film is a mesmerizing ride to hell, with Cage as the perfect conductor. There is a light at the end of all this, preventing this film from existing only as a compleat downer.",__label__2
"Awful: It's just an awful movie. It's not quite as bad as 'Eye of The Beholder' starring Ewan McGregor, but pretty close. Awful acting by Kilmer, Mendez, and Cage.

The silver ring around the face really shows it off. Sits high and is a serious sports watch but I'm wearing it at the hospital.",__label__2
"Not quite the booze I expected: This is an updated publication of a c. 1980 text. It is very informative on the properties of fuel alcohol and the different raw material possibilities. It also explains in some detail how to make ethanol on the farm-scale from improvised DIY equipment.It would benefit from a more up-to-date context and a slightly more commercial orientation, in my opinion.",__label__1
"Ethanol is for drinking: I would not recommend this book. Anyone looking into alternative fuel should consider biodiesel, or electric power. Ethanol is a waste. Anyway, this book provides some useless diagrams of how to not make a still at home.",__label__1
"Needs a better string quartet: As a musician and musicology student, I am very familar with both the ""classical"" world of music, and the popular world of music, and I have to say that perhaps string quartet versions of R.E.M. might be interesting, but you need a creative and enterprising quartet (such as Kronos Quartet, etc.) to do this. This CD is greatly disappointing because the transcriptions are simplistic and lacking imagination. String quartet recordings can be very exciting, but not here!",__label__1
"Regarding Tribute to REM String Quartet.: Wow, I just bought this CD and I was surprised to see how poorly reviewed it was. Actually, that is the primary reason for my participation in this review... to offer a positive and encouraging reason to purchase this compact disc. I found the music to be refreshing and beautiful and, despite what other reviews have said, found the musicians to be quite talented. It's a good CD to relax to, have a dinner party to, et cetera. It's not REM, don't expect to hear REM. It is, however, a string quartet who brings a refreshing twist to most of REM's popular songs.",__label__2
"Not a tribute -- a disgrace!: A disgrace to both REM and the work of good quartets. The idea is enticing, but the quartet's execution is awful. Truly terrible. Dull. Choppy. Uninteresting. Same. I'd say boring, but I can't stand to listen to it long enough to get bored. It's so bad I was compelled to log onto this website just to see if I could get my money back. I see the quartet doesn't even have a name -- I can understand why. It's advertised as just ""The String Quartet Tribute to R.E.M."" and it lists the players. Maybe someone else could do better, but I doubt it, as the arrangements are bad too. Sorry to say it, but this CD is truly awful!",__label__1
"Skip the quartet, and go for the whole orchestra.: This is one of those albums I wish I hadn't paid for. It's an interesting curiosity for the REM fan, but I find it nearly un-listenable. The arrangements simply destroy most of the REM sound. My advice: pass this one by, and pick up the disc from the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.",__label__1
"Lock Lace Brown: Works as advertised, wish I could just buy the locks without the laces. I use the locks on other items, works great holding my hat on in windy weather.",__label__2
Great item!: I bought these as a replacement when our new puppy chewed the end off of a similar type lace on my husband's favorite shoes. They come with easy to follow instructions and after a few minutes all was as good as new and harmony was restored! (shoes are now kept well away from puppy!),__label__2
"Difficult to attach to boots: Too difficult to attach to my shoes...I prefer to tie my laces, even though I may have to do it more than once.",__label__1
"2 Unlimited is back, but not as you'd expect them to.: They're back, not as Anita & Ray but as Romy and Marion. The song ""Wanna Get Up"" in (my) opinion is not as good as other tracks released by the band, since there's no techno-rapping by Ray, and not as good vocals & lyrics. On previous 2 Unlimited tracks Ray & Anita wrote most lyrics and sung well. On ""Wanna Get Up"" vocals are written by other producers. Struggling to make the song good, on many European charts it never made it into the top five. The single includes three remixes, the ""SASH! Extended Edit"" is the best remix, and song, which give the single the two of five stars. It is better than the original version. The other two remixes are extrermely poor and do not relate with the type of music 2 Unlimited sings.",__label__1
"Finches love it but so do squirrels: This is a nice looking feeder and it attracted lots of beautiful finches, but the squirrels quickly figured out how to pop out the plastic inserts so that the seed spills out onto the ground. It is a poor design to have removable inserts in the feeding ports. Overall, a waste of money as I have to buy a new one now.",__label__1
"Missing parts: I received this bird feeder, liked it, but when I tried to assemble it someof the parts were missing. The hooded pieces were missing.",__label__1
It's finally gonna happen!!! WhooHoo!!!: I can't believe this is finally coming to DVD!Three's Company has always been my 'all time' favorite show.I never get sick of watching John Ritter's extraordinary talent.I just hope the other seasons are released quickly.There are quite a few and I want them all!,__label__2
Great service: I was very happy with my product I absolutely love it!!! And it was brand new at a very reasonable price. Gonna continue my shopping on amazon.,__label__2
2nd season: Great item. Will buy more in the future. Great gifts. Thanks for your great and quick response. Thanks again. Goodbye,__label__2
Always delivers the laughs...: It brought home an old classic - I can watch these guys over and over again.,__label__2
"horrid DVD: Love the show, which for me has held up well: it's obviously dated but still makes me laugh.What didn't make me laugh, though, was the quality of this DVD. The quality of the transfer, it's as though you're still watching it on VHS! It doesn't support surround-sound, even by just repeating the two channels.There are no subtitles in any language, and no special features of any kind!Worse, mine had scratches right out of the plastic! The scene where Jack comes up to the breakfast table in his speedos is all pixelated. Was that true for anybody else?",__label__1
Clear cut disc: no problems whatsoeverI remember why I love the show so muchthis DVD is much cheaper here than at other retailersI wonder why though only 6 episodes on the 1st season...maybe they needed for it to catch onthats understandablethere's a great memorial feature for John Ritter too,__label__2
"Comedy doesn't get much better!: I remember watching Three's Company on TV, and I'm so glad it's available on DVD now... I have all the seasons! Seaons One introduces the group, and the laughs don't stop! I laughed out loud at every episode in this season! I absolutely love Three's Company! It's just so funny and entertaining! John Ritter (Jack) is classic... one of the best comedians! And the interactions with Joyce (Janet) and Suzanne (Chrissy) always makes me laugh out loud. For a good laugh, and overall great entertainment, Three's Company is tops! Enjoy!",__label__2
"A OK ~ Three's Company Season 1: I'm glad Three's Company was put on DVD. It was a good show back in its days and it is still a good show. I can't wait to buy the Second Season when it comes out in the spring of 2004. If you have never seen any of the shows, I suggest you start watching and own this DVD. You won't stop laughing.",__label__2
"Best Show Ever!!: I loved Three's Company since I was a child, John Ritter is hilarious. I was upset when the Ropers left the show at the end of the third season, it was a lost! Norman Fell is so funny...I was devistated when I heard about John Ritter's death, he won't be forgotten...We will miss you, John. Can't wait for the second season. Buy it and you won't regret it. It makes you laugh so much...",__label__2
"Show=Amazing , DVD=RUSHED: One of my favorite shows ever, the DVD itself was rushed to capitalize on John Ritter's death. This is what I hate about movie studios, it's all about the money and not about quality. Thumbs down to the transfer, thumbs down to the menus, thumbs down to the speed of menu access.Remember, I'm not rating the show because it would get 10 stars. The transfer is garbage.John you are the man. Sorry about this quality!",__label__1
"Can't wait no longer.: Ever since I discovered that this was being released on dvd, I have been bursting out with retarded noises of delightful joy! I am very excited about the release of my very favorite televisionsitcom,Threes Company, because of the many laughs I get from watching it mostly. You will not regret buying it, and that is a guaranteed guarantee!",__label__2
A lesson to be learned: I thought that because the DVD stated Season One that I was getting the entire season one. Much to my surprise it only included six episodes. I now know that unless it states COMPLETE season it isn't. I was quite disappointed and feel that the advertising is misleading.,__label__1
"Why not Spanish ???: Alguien me puede decir porque la serie Three's Company no viene ni con audio ni con subtitulos en ESPAÑOL.Esta serie fue vista a nivel mundial, si casi todas las series que salen en dvd con varios idiomas que paso con esta si es una de las mejores de todos los tiempos.Una comedia excelente y unica deberian de haber tomado en cuenta aca en mi pais la dieron con audio en español, donde quedo eso ???.Ahora si viene en audio ESPAÑOL o por lo menos subtitulo pido mil disculpas pero no dice por ningun lado en la descripcion del producto.SALUDOS",__label__1
JACK THE IDJIT: I think Three's Company is the WORST sitcom there EVER was on telivision. Bad writing BAD acting and JUST PLAIN BAD all the way around. The horrible thing was it was SO bad you sometimes felt compelled to watch it in spite of your better judgement. PAINFULLY stupid plots.,__label__1
"Where's your underwear?!!!!!: I have very fond memories of this wonderful DVD set. I really appreciate that the producers put on the DVD season extras, and left the shows 100% complete. No commercial interruptions is such a nice treat. I remember they used to show oodles of commercials between the segments, and cut them up, in syndication.Love it!MC White said: Check it out!",__label__2
"A Legend: Three's Company will always be the best comedy show that was on TV. When I heard that John Ritter had passed I did shed tears for the man because he was the best and will always be the best comedian out there. I have been waiting for the show to come out on DVD for a very long time. When I was a kid I would beg my mom to stay up so that I could watch the show. John Ritter will be deeply missed by all his fans. Rest In Peace John, we all miss you!",__label__2
three's company: I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since DVDS came out. This is my favorite show. You must buy this TV show this is the best ever. I have been watching this show since i was little. I just love John Ritter shows and movies he is so funny. I'm going to miss him. Rest in peace John.,__label__2
Spanish: In description this serie specific dubbed to spanish but is not real only English language. Not subtitules in spanish.Mal mal mal. But Is very funny.,__label__1
"Classic!: Yes, you can catch this program running in syndication frequently on many different channels, so why buy it? Well, I started thinking about a time in the future where it may cease to be aired and I feel this is a show that will continue to make me laugh way into my golden years :) . Yes, the situations they get into at times is over the top, but I know that I like watching television to ""escape"" my life and this is great entertainment. All of the actors do a great job, but John Ritter was a genius in his acting and comedic timing.",__label__2
"Excellent, albeit short, DVD presentation.: This is one of those ""it's about time"" DVD releases. The first season of ""Three's Company"" was a short one, given only six episodes. But it was wonderful to see them in their original colorful, vibrant presentations. The show stands the test of time and this is a must-own DVD for any classic TV fan.The only fault, naturally, is the lack of features and the small number of episodes. It might have worked better if they had combined this with season two and released a loaded collection next year. As it stands, season two will be released next year and I fully expect a five-star collection.",__label__2
a good deal: Alot of people have complained that this could not possibly be the entire first season of the show but it is.... Even if the show had such a short first season it was still a really good deal. It arrived right when it was supposed to and it's a pretty good aswell!,__label__2
"CLASSIC: This is the season that started it all. Originally a mid-season replacement, Three's Company became such a bona fide (and can you believe?) controversial show that ABC ordered up a full second season. The premise of the show is simple: Chrissy and Janet need a third roommate tp help with the bills when they meet Jack Tripper. The only problem? The landlord, Mr. Roper, won't allow a man to live with two women. The solution? Tell him Jack pitches for the other team. The show is heavy on farce (A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect) and John Ritter's Jack is the highlight with his physical comedy. The show went on to last eight years and inspired two spin-offs: ""The Ropers"" and ""Three's a Crowd."" There is a reason this show has lasted so long on syndication. Watch this set and you'll see why.",__label__2
"Great 1st Season: Yeah,great start to the series.Pity there is only 6 episodes in the 1st season.Already watched it loads of times.John Ritters humor as usual stands out.No extras on this dvd.But all the episodes are good.Here are the episodes.01. A Man about the house02. And Mother makes four03. Roper's niece04. No children, no dogs05. Jack the giant killer06. It's only moneyBuy it!So we can get all the seasons released.This show rulz.",__label__2
"Thank You!: I am sooooooooooo happy that this show is making its way to DVD. With so many other shows getting to DVD, its nice to see a true classic in stock. Plus, with season one being on DVD, I won't have to try to record the episodes on Nick at Nite every night (although I just might).",__label__2
"A must-have: I grew up with Jack, Janet, Chrissy, etc. I watched all 6 episodes straight through one night and laughed my butt off with each episode. The only complaint I have is that there are only 6 episodes and I was left wanting more. I can't wait for season 2!!",__label__2
"jack, janet, and chrissy: The first season of Three's Company. One of the funniest sitcoms around. The story of two girls, who need a roommate. After throwing a party (in the first episode) Janet and Chrissy find a man sleeping in their bathtub. . .eventually, they become roommates.A lot of storylines on the show revolved around misconceptions, and misunderstandings. The on-going joke that the landlord thinks that Jack is gay. In the first three seasons, the landlords are an older couple named The Ropers. And their on-going joke about him not wanting to sleep with her. Kind of like Al Bundy, on Married...with Children.Guaranteed many laughs. Rest in peace John Ritter.",__label__2
Come And Knock On Our Door.........: I was THRILLED to find this at Wal-Mart for $5.50. I LOVED this show growing up and now owning it and watching it again just makes me smile and brings back those memories. What a great show. We we always think of John Ritter fondly and miss him greatly.,__label__2
"Come And Knock on Our Door: I got this for Christmas,and I haven't watched it,yet. I want seasons 2-4. We'll miss you John Ritter,Rest in Peace.I'm still waiting for 8 Simple Rules Season 1 to come out on DVD.",__label__2
"=^): this is such a cute show! even after all these years im still in love with all the charactors and even the reruns are fun to watch. EVERY season of Three's company's great, definatly worth the $$",__label__2
three's company: this is one of the best comedy ever in the world tv until now i am still watching this comedy every time,__label__2
classic television: What can I say about this show except it is a good example of what a classic series is all about. Any John Ritter fan has to add this to their collection. I intend to purchase the entire series.,__label__2
"Another nightmare about the remove cassette message: I have had this camera for 18 months and about 2 months ago, it started beeping at me to eject the tape almost every time I used it. I went on-line and found that this is common with this camera for some reason. I was able to prevent major problems by removing the tape after each use, but that no longer works. Now I cannot record or watch any tape without it forcing me to remove the cassette. I was very fond of this camera until it stopped working. I am very disappointed that I will now have to buy a new camcorder (a local repairman estimated over $200 to fix it). I have a friend who has the exact same camera and he has yet to have a problem, but it isn't worth the risk.",__label__1
"Very annoying humming sound - be sure it doesn't bother you: Basically a nice unit. Loaded with all the features you could ever want: plenty of optical zoom, digital stabilizer, very compact size, reasonable warranty, and good looks too.BUT...this camera has a VERY annoying buzzing/humming sound to it. I called Canon and they said it's ""normal for that unit."" Excuse me?Maybe for some people, the buzz is not annoying. But compared to my cheap, old 8mm, this is much, much noisier. I would recommend you try it before you buy it. Don't get wooed by the display models.",__label__1
"I liked it at first: It was a pretty good camera until it stopped working. One day I turned it on and it started beeping and flasshing an eject tape message. But you couldn't eject the tape and the camera would not respond to anything. I had the camera just over two years when this happened. Luckily I purchased an extended warranty at Best Buy. Best Buy sent the camera to Canon for repair. Canon would not repair it because it would be too expensive so, Best Buy gave me a new camera. And I was allowed to get a different brand, so I went with a Sony Handycam.",__label__1
"BEWARE of ZR45MC Tape loading mechanism!!!!: I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept '02. I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it.",__label__1
Great Camera: This is a very easy to use camera with excellent video. Read the reviews and did not hear any humming noise when operating and the low light pictures were very good. The still pictures are good for the internet but are not good enough quality to use as a regular camera.,__label__2
Not good enough: This camcorder is good enough for me except for one thing: if you are going to need a light or external microphone you should get the ZR50MC because of its advanced accessory shoe. The lights and microphones that I can find are designed for the advanced accessory shoe. The built-in microphone is too sensitive to use in many cases because it even picks up the sound when I tap the handle of my tripod lightly.,__label__2
"Remove the cassetter problem...again: As with others, this was a great camera until the remove cassette problem appeared 8 months ago. Now it barely plays or records. I'm never buying another Canon and going back to Sony. BTW, the buzzing is the automatic microphone gain. If there's not enough sound to record it cranks up the input volume so much that you hear the tape motor.",__label__1
"Horrible...: I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one.",__label__1
"Nice camera, when it works: I love the features and optics of this camera. I love everything about it, except that it really doesn't work and their service is terrible. Many people posted about the humming sound -- I didn't have that problem. But the electrical system was intermittent from the time I got the camera. I've sent it to them three times, and each time they repair it, or claim to. Now it is out of warranty and the battery still doesn't work. So I'll have to buy a new camera and hope that you don't make the same mistake I did -- go with a different camera.",__label__1

"A great CD: Yeah, yeah, we know she has a loaded last name; anyway, a CD ought to be listened to on its own merits. As far as I am concerned, this is a keeper.Charlotte Gainsbourg's soft, mellow voice perfectly fits Air's melodies.",__label__2
"5:55 Charlotte Gainsbourg: What a great album!!! I never knew she sang as well. I have seen her in French movies and enjoyed greatly her acting in those movies. Now I even adore her more, because not only can she act, but she can sing as well!!!Go Charlotte Go!!!! Can't wait for her next album.",__label__2
"She can't sing!: This album received a fair amount of critical acclaim, so I thought I'd give it a listen. Well so much for critics! Gainsbourg can't sing a lick. She makes people like Britney Spears, Jessical Simpson & Janet Jackson sound like Beverly Sills or Marilyn Horne. The producers must recognize this too, because her voice is mixed very low on most of the tracks. On top of not being able to sing, she doesn't compose and doesn't play an instrument. So why is there a CD bearing her name? You got me. Maybe cashing in on daddy's renown? The botton line is don't waste your money. If you want to hear some good French CDs, check out ""Hors de Toute Doute"" or ""Le Silence des Roses"" by France D'Amour (from Quebec).",__label__1
"hollow, lame and prescindible...: I bought this album in the hope of finding some kind of chic, interesting tunes ""a la French"", to match with her voice that I remembered from the past, but there's absolutelly nothing interesting inside: some elevator's music that won't disturb you in any given context. Utterly prescindible...",__label__1
"KAY ARE A PEE: Um, hello? Has anyone noticed that this woman doesn't know how to sing? Most songs are an over-baked litany of melodramatic metaphors that add up to ... what? Others appear to be some sort of short story told in the past tense. All are whisper-talked by the artist in her faux Gallic/Brit accent that wears poorly as the CD progresses. The few times when the producers require her to actually hit a note are cringe-inducing.I wanted to like this record and spent $15 of hard-earned cash on it. But I guess there's a good reason why she's only dragged out of storage every ten years.",__label__1
"A different Charlotte: Charlotte Gainsbourg 5:55 borrows more from ""Air"" than from her father Serge, and is a complete departure from her previous works. I had hoped that she would've stuck to French, but being the daughter of British singer/actress Jane Birkin (after whom the famous French luxury goods maker Hermès named one of its lines), her English is impeccable and sounds quite sexy. This is a good, solid performance, albeit not one that will keep you awake.",__label__2
"Red Allen's hot session: Brilliant music made by old friends from the era when swing was still forming but at the same time the foundations of modern jazz were layed in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra (""Queer Notions"" and some other songs).This is a really hot and swinging Henry ""Red"" Alllen's slightly dixielandish date, featuring Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax) J. C. Higginbotham (trombone), Buster Bailey (clarinet), Cozy Cole (dm), as well as some younger but still hot players.However, the leader is particularly expressive in the ballad ""I Cover the Waterfront"" - no wonder I found it cited as one of the classical Allen's performances. Late fifties were good not only for modern explorations: this hot hi fi session gives great joy to us fans of classical jazz who sometimes whish that the recording technology in the 20's and 30's was a bit more advanced...",__label__2

korny: One of the worst compilations ever. Some of the new synth music is cheap & corny. Even the ganymede song is bad on this album. I like my synth music to have some meat to it. All these songs sond like little kids playing new wave for a day. If you want some good new synth new wave music check out de/vision and Iris and mesh.,__label__1
"Excellent Ski Tours for the Western Sierra: This book has 59 tours in the Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Park areas and around Huntington Lake. Describes some beautiful country. Each tour is rated with difficulty, length, elevatnion, navigation, time, and season. The USGS topos for the tour are listed, along with excellent tour maps. Each tour has a description of what you see, where to start, and leads you thorough the tour.I like the book, but I would also like to see an index and more tours for the Yosemite high country.",__label__2
"A Watershed Work!: This is the definitive watershed work that brought Buddhism to the West and explains it in a manner that's very easy for Westerners to understand. It is a wonderful book that uses a question and answer structure like the Catholic Catechism to enlighten the reader on the Buddhist faith. It covers every aspect of Buddhism and there's much to learn from it whether you are a beginner or a master or from the East or the West. I strongly recommend this book. I got so much out of it. This book answers a lot of very important questions, including ones that I have had for some time. It's been a real blessing to me.",__label__2
"A good review of the facts ...: It is a catechism ... what more to say? It does the job, presents the facts and gives a lot of information in concise form that can be used for further study. What it is not is a prayer book, philosophical discussion or flowery inspirational work. It is a catechism.",__label__2
Not for novices: Not very useful. Perhaps too high a level for a layman like me. Seems to be written for a serious student of Buddism.,__label__1
"A Good Synopsis of Mainstream Buddhism: The contrived question and answer format didn't bother me too much, and actually covered a lot of ground in an engaging way. I liked this book.",__label__2
if interested in knowledge of the buddist religion; this is a must book: from start to finish it left you with knowledge and a possible desire to get in deeper. i read the entire book in only two sessions.,__label__2
Provides a great foundation for further studies.: This is a very handy little book. It answered many fundamental questions I had about the Buddhist philosophy. The book helped me to realize that I am a Buddhist - no matter where I am in my path.,__label__2
"Excellent!: I have several photography books that I have had no desire to read from cover to cover. Then I found this one! This is by far the best photography book that I have laid my eyes on. I am reading it cover to cover and plan on reading it again. John Garret has written it in such a fun, simple way that really makes you understand photography. I've even learned more from this book than I have in a photography class that I have taken.If you are just getting started in your photography adventure, I highly recommend this book!",__label__2
"great book, good service: The book arrived in a little more time than I expected, but it was within the time frame indicated. However, I am happy with the book's condition. It's better that described. Great book and price.",__label__2
"Good Overall Book: I just took a photography course and this book was one of the ones recommended. It is a little shallow, but covers all the basics and all the items covered in the class. It covers all the various topis from portrait to building photog as well as types of cameras, etc. If you want a basic book, this is the one to get. However, if you are looking for a lot of depth, keep looking. Then again, it is ""Keep it Simple"" so it delivers just what it says.",__label__2
"KISS Guide to Photography: While old and out of print, this book is a very good way to learn the basics of photography. You have to ignore most of the references to digital cameras as the technology has changed a lot.",__label__2
"outdated!!! although several book been out there for a long time, this book is also basic: I bought this book two months ago... It's outdated.It might include the information you are looking for, but at a very basic level. I went with the ""Undestanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson, and with ""The Digital Photography"". Both have outstanding reviews... and these will do the trick teaching you what you need to know to take great/almost pro photos...",__label__1
"Plastic pulley, not metal.: The pulley is plastic, not metal as pictured. I've added a photo to show the actual item that I received.

"Mixed Bag: This compilation contains some of the best jazz guitar ever in songs like Scotland I, the Jam with Albert and Yin. Unfortunately it also digs up silly tripe like Eyes of Love, Planet End, Adam Smasher and Rene's Theme. The shorter compilation, the Essential Larry Coryell is less expensive, more consistent and manifestly superior to this double CD.",__label__1
"Great take on unlikely standards...: Gelfand and his acolytes make solid and original jazz out of music usually associated with children. These arrangements are simply delightful, my favorite being ""Passe-Partout"" a theme I knew by heart as a 4-year-old in '78. Gelfand not only arranges the themes well, his interpretations and solos on the piano shows that they could have a great new life as jazz!",__label__2

Should be Free with purchase of Belkin OmniView. Why sell separate?: This item should come free with a Belkin OmniView.

"Delicious Electronics...: I had purchased Cirrus' second album first (Back on a Mission) and it really appealed to a broad electronic audience, but Drop the Break is probably more for pure ""electronic heads."" This album is mostly big beat songs with electronic remixes and some interesting live elements. However, amidst all the big beat and electronic songs, 'October 27' stands out as a truly beautiful slow-er song. It almost reminds me of some of BT's work. I hope I never get tired of hearing that track.The big picture: The Cirrus boys have alot of talent and if you like their music stlyes or big beat/dance/electronic music then this is a must have for your collection.

And seeing the addition of vocals, bass and guitars to a dance outfit piqued my interest. Unfortunately, it didn't hold it. Nothing really bad here, it just didn't make much impression. ""Drop the Break"" is OK, and I liked the trance-y feel of ""Yallah Habibe"". The only other impression I got was the rather silly lyrics on ""Abduction"". Serviceable for background music, but not really an album I could get into.",__label__1
Not as good as Counterfeit CD...: To put it bluntly... I hate this CD. I thought I would like it because I fell head over heels in love with Cirrus' Counterfeit CD. I listened to that CD for a week straight I loved it so much... then I got this CD. It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed. It's one of the few CDs of mine that I would love to just toss in the trash and I rarely get a CD that I hate. It was worth all of the 69 cents I paid for it on Amazon.,__label__1

"Great Read: Anyone who thinks that becoming addicted to Valium can't happen to them should read this book. Brutally honest it follows Barbara Gordon, a successful award winning documentary film maker, through her addiction to Valium and her painful struggle to get off. This is a great read. I won this from Goodreads.",__label__2
Loved this book: You hear about prescription drug addiction but don't really understand it. This book takes you into Barbara's life with such an addiction. The writing is excellent. There is so much detail regarding her struggle back to a normal productive life. I have a new respect for individuals and their families with this illness.,__label__2
"Still One of the Best: A number of books about substance abuse have come out since ""I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can,"" but it still should be on the bookshelves (or Kindle) of everyone directly or indirectly involved with addiction. Gordon's straightforward description of the mental, emotional, and physical symptoms endured by a recovering addict has a powerful universality. It helps all of us understand the complex and excruciating process of recovery. - Ann Seymour, author of ""I've Always Loved You""",__label__2
Very good heart wrenching story: I read this book many years ago. I was touched by her story. I can not speak for the Kindle formatting on this. Only to the books content. Excellent.,__label__2
"Now I'm confused ;-): I read this book 24 years ago, after having just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Reading it helped me tremendously in understanding what my ex was doing. That's what I remember about this book. So, now reading the reviews, that all mention the book being about valium addiction, I'm kind of surprised that I only remember the parts that resonated with my own life at the time. To me this book was extremely powerful and I've recommended it to other strong women that have been in emotionally abusive relationship. So, I think I will have to reread the book to see, if the abuse was really only such a small part of the book and not really what it is about.",__label__2
"Review of book: I didn't care for this book at all - in fact, I stopped reading it several times because it droned on and on about the writer's depression - so much so, it made me depressed! I wanted to read about her recovery - and after more than half of the book behind me, I was still looking for that. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!",__label__1

This book gives you an overview of the most common options you have, without the depressing statistics about lung cancer. If you fight for your health, statistics aren't that important after all.However, there are a lot of pages about coping with cancer 'socially', which may be important to some people, but that is information I was not really looking for. And the health system in de USA is a different from the system in Europe (dealing with doctors, insurance, that kind of things).But it is by far the best introduction book about lung cancer I have been reading so far.

"Dumb Guns...but great soundtrack: Christopher Lambert and Ice-T are supposed to be the stars here, but what little depth this movie has comes from Michael Halsey, who turns a professional killer into a sympathetic figure (and that ANYONE can earn any sympathy in this bit of video treacle is itself an achievement).If you're not a big fan of bloodless, mindless gunplay, the only reason to buy this movie is for the soundtrack. Mambo fans will actually enoy it, as well as the Andean flute/guitar instrumental.",__label__1
"Mean Guns Doesn't Mean Any Good: This film is a travesty of the action-adventure genre. First off, the plot is illogical and absurd even if it might be a policeman's dream: all the major criminals around congregate at a prison and kill each other in one enormous shootout. That essentially is the plot of the movie.Adding to the ""fun"" is excruciating, repetitive dialogue where the major characters attempt to bare their souls. At the end of these long-winded discourses, one fervently wishes these characters to be brutally killed for being so insufferably boring and pretentious.Oh yes, how can one forget the equally irratating mambo-inflected film score which blares loudly. and repetitively, over the soundtrack? Unfortunately, it's not loud enough to drown out the dreadful dialogue.Mean guns doesn't mean a thing.",__label__1
"In a Nutshell: Mambo Murder: I've now seen the film Mean Guns twice and I have even purchased the DVD (albeit off of a bargain rack). This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in.",__label__1
"A very strange and bad movie: Albert Pyun has his own way of making films. He is responsible for ""Omega Doom"" and ""Crazy Six"", two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. ""Mean Guns"" follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts. Unhappily, that is not enough to maintain the interest for this bad film.",__label__1
"Completely UNREVISED AND OUTDATED!: I was very disappointed in this book. I have found shop set up for effecient layout and dust collection to be the most important aspects of my woodworking. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched.",__label__1
"OK if you have an unlimited budget and dream: Lots of great ideas for those with unlimited budgets. Many of the suggestions are not within the economic means for those thinking about setting up a shop; although the author includes many photo's for the ""Dream"" shop. Most references to tools include equipment that costs $1,000's (or more!). Lot's of fluff from the author and plentiful color photos of shop layouts, tools, and equipment that the average ""Joe"" would spend decades purchasing. Not too much ""practical"" information about ""The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop"". Definately a dream.",__label__1
"A lovely book, but short on specifics.: This is a beautiful book and terrific fun for a woodworker to read for enjoyment, but it's short on specific solutions. Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere.",__label__1
"Excellent and informative: This is a very clear, thorough, well-written book. It details many aspects of setting up a small wood shop, from layout to electrical work to insulation and soundproofing. The author also talks about what tools to select and suggests a priority order for people who cannot get all they want at once. It is an excellent source of information for anyone from hobbyists to beginning professionals.",__label__2
"Packed with info: I was looking for a book about the shop space itself, and this was right on the money. There one chapter on general tools that one would need, but that's it. The rest is dedicated to preparing a space for a woodshop. There is a lot of attention paid to outbuilding-type 'dream' shops most of us will never have, but electricity, surface treatment, storage, etc. are all still applicable. Every chapter is a reference itself. The table of contents is clear and makes it easy to find what you may be interested in.",__label__2
"Very useful eye candy...: Yep, there are a lot of ""dream shops"" in this book. But ton's of ideas for those of us that are ""monitarilly challenged"". I found a lot of good ideas for storage and space utilization from the pictures and text. Admittedly the most of the shop layouts will not work for me, but I can sure use bits and pieces. I didn't buy this book, got it at the library, but I believe I will buy it just as a reference for ideas. Recommend it highly for just this reason.",__label__2
"Not worth it: Fairly poor. Lots of photos of badly set up shops, and ego-stroking of the shop owners, but no guidance on how to lay out a shop well.",__label__1
"weak advice: The best thing I found in this book is the picture on the cover. Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made.",__label__1
"Nearly Sanders Best: It took a while to get into this cd. Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock's Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an ""ambient"" percussion section that makes you want to say ""laswell is a genius."" This is followed by an ""afro-pop"" song/rap that makes you want to say ""why does Laswell have to mess with everything."" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the ""smooth jazz"" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah's best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes.",__label__2
"Great CD: This is a great CD. Buy It. (You know you want to) Every track is hip and contain a variety of styles and elements from great vocals to some of the more ""out side"" stuff. This CD can be enjoyed by people who are not hard core jazz fans.",__label__2
"He who doesnt laugh at this cd must have a hart of stone!: This record discusted me, mr Sanders ought to think less about money and care more for the quality of the music! I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn't get it. Dont buy this cd, its popular music in its worst sense. Instead you should buy a record with John Coltrane. In his latet period he is in to the same themes as Sanders but shows that this doesnt necessarily lead to kitsch.",__label__1
"Avoid: I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album ""Ask The Ages"" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance.",__label__1

I have already imported Alice In Wonderland and Iron Man 2 from Amazon.com because the locals tried to force me to buy a DVD.

The camera work is outstanding the way they follow the motorcycle in one scene is really a rush just watching it. It opens up with action and gives you just enough to make it a really good movie.One of the MANY reasons I love this movie is the hero. I watch a lot of kungfu, and this type of storyline for mel is kungfu at it's finest. He really reminded me of a guy like Jimmy Wang Yu or even one of my favorites Chen Kwan Tai(baddie from crippled avengers). Mel plays the role just as good as any of them and maybe better.The commentary is also listenable and a pretty good making of.",__label__2

Like guns, bladed weapons and determination. It follows a man who means to stop criminals and terrorists in similar ways to the Punisher. It has cool quotes and good graphics for a 70's movie, and I liked it a lot so I am looking forward to the sequels, Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. If you like bang em up movies with morals, see it.",__label__2
"Cult classic...: There is no doubt that this is a cult classic, and there is plenty of reason for it to stay that way. Overall, it was predictable and somewhat lacking in screen presence. I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes the film worth the purchase, but I will admit that it is an interesting example of Australian movie making in the 70's.The story line is somewhat disturbed and there are significant reasons to not allow children to watch this, and really, there is little reason for me to suggest that anyone not completely bored with other avenues of moviemaking watch it either.",__label__1

Despite that, his metamorphosis comes to fruition in ""Thunderdome,"" in which Max regains his humanity to the fullest degree.Side made several in Australia before this one, and the one to see is ""Tim,"" in which Mel gives an incredible performance that's about as opposite of an apocalyptic anti-hero as anyone could get.

"CLASSIC ACTION MOVIE: Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget, with some startling, influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers, Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid, a broken, monoslylabic, avenging angel in souped up pursuit car. Very much a character in the vain of Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the spaghetti westerns, Max is a brooding, intense man with a capacity for terrible violence.",__label__2

I understand that the decision to overdub the part was done when the movie was first released in the US (an Australian friend recalled his shock at the dubbing when he saw it in a US cinema at the time) but I would have thought that the studio could have dug up the original Australian version and released that instead.

The later one, though, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" is the one everybody knows.This one is low-budget filmmaking at its best.Two points:1. For some absurd reason those who put out this DVD decided to dub the original ""Australian"" into American English. What an insult. Really, how dumb do they think we are?2. Interesting that while in the popular imagination the Mad Max paradigm has come to mean post-Apocalyptic chaos, in this first one, the world is more or less as normal as the Apocalypse hasn't occurred yet.3.

After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading ""Mad"". Grinding action sequences and Gibson's cool headed attitude make Han Solo look like second hand trash.

So, because of this I bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original, I found the U.S version very disappointing.

I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie. FOUR stars ONLY because it doesn't include the original Australian dialog. The sequels are wannabes and don't deserve a SINGLE star.",__label__2
"Mad Mel: I wouldn't waste a single red cent on anything that this jew hating,racist,woman abuser acts in.This guy is a complete and utter psychopath!",__label__1
"This film is horrible: As a fan of post-apocalyptic movies, I must say that this movie is as far from post-apocalyptic as a post-apocalyptic movie can get. The majority of the movie is explained on the back cover- Mad Max is a cop whose family has been killed and he must seek revenge. But the seeking revenge part is just about 4 or 5 scenes towards the end of the movie! And to top it all off it seems like the apocalypse has had absolutely no effect on the world, because trees are growing, there's power, water, civilization, medicine, and ice cream! Jeez!",__label__1
"Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen: I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It's the worst highly rated movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying ""WTF?"" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better.",__label__1
"Don't buy this version it is DUBBED for the America Market: It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version.",__label__1
"Not worth buying!: I am a huge Mad Max fan, so when I found this copy I was really happy (it's hard to find in store) I waited for it to get delivered and sat down with the partner to watch, only I was so disappointed when it was finished as they have cut out half of the original movie!!!Majority of the major scenes are no where to be seen!!I must admit this is the first time I have been let down by Amazon, but with such a classic movie (with the correct rating) why was there any reason to cut out soooooo much of it, for a person who may not have seen this before, they would have no real idea as to what the movie is!!!",__label__1
"Gives you a nice urban 'western' type film - Mel , not Clint: This film will give those who never thought much of Australian films either more fuel for the fire or a wake up call .This is a classic and I suppose there are some who would call it a cult film , but it is full of intense performances and whilst not science fiction , it does have an otherwordly quality to it .Forget Mel Gibson is in it - watch this film for its own brand of drama , revenge , thrills , action and good old fashioned mean-heartedness .If you think about it , the plot for this film was recycled for 'Gladiator' , which was another breakthrough film for an actor from the Aussie part of the world .Buy and enjoy this distinctive film on DVD , with a healthy and worthwhile dose of extras .",__label__2

"not as go as the road warrior,but a very good low-budget action movie: in this first mad max movie mel gibson(looking very young) is a cop in the near future where war and crime is pushing the world into a new and deadly dark age. motercycle gangs roam the road ways and sack and pillage everything they can get their hands on! after several run ins with them,max sends his wife and child away to protect them,only to have the gang find them and kill them in a most unpleseant way. now max,half mad,sets out to kill them all,at any cost!while not as great as the road warrior,this is a dandy little revenge movie and has some great stunt driving! this sets up the reason why max is so cold and mean in the road warrior and it makes the road warrior that much better if you see this one first.the transfer is great and the use of the non dubed soundtrack helps make this one you need! check it out!!!",__label__2
"Good revenge-type movie: If you did not know it starred a very young Mel Gibson, you would have never believed that it was really him. This movie was a really good revenge movie. The only problem I had with it was trying to make out what was being said. It is done in ""Australian language"" and, though it is basically English, the accents of most except for Mel Gibson's character are so strong that you really have to over-listen to try and figure out what is being said. Other than that, the movie was a good movie and the crash scenes were fantastic for the era in which it was made. I only wish I could have understood what everyone was saying without straining in order to get even half of the dialogue. But, it is a movie well worth viewing.",__label__2
mad max: this film is one of my all time favorites but i have to say the picture quality of the video is very poor i am needless to say dissapointed,__label__1
"When do we go for a ride?!: Ever since the first time I watched this movie, I have loved it. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors to ever come onto the big screen. I have the VHS version of ""Mad Max"", but it pales badly to the new special edition DVD. I had looked at buying an Australian version, I'm glad I waited. The best part about the DVD is the ability to either watch the American dubbed version(ick) or the Aussie version. The American dubbing really knocked out a lot of the background noise that the DVD brings out... sirens, horns, a lot of little sounds that I've never heard on the tape...believe me, I've watched this tape many, many times... I think I could recite it in my sleep... TWO THUMBS UP FOR THE DVD VERSION!!!!!!",__label__2
"Dubs are BAD: Do not, under any circumstances, get this movie dubbed if you have the same opportunity to get it in its original sound format, with the original voices. The original is far superior to the dubbed version, no matter how difficult the thick Australian accents of its actors may be to understand. While it is a good movie even with the dubbed voicing, it is a far better movie with all its original voices intact.",__label__2
"Dubbing is bad: Good movie, bad dubbing. Please releast the origanl version. I took one star off becuse of the dubbing.",__label__2
"A household name...: I loved this movie when I first saw it, and still love it, after seeing it about 30 times. So who cares if the trick blower can't be made? Everytime I think about replacing my gas guzzling 454 truck, this film reminds me that there really ain't many things in life as sweet as a rumbling V8. A perfect guy movie. For whatever reason, most women just don't get it. BE WARNED though. The original release was overdubbed with cheezy american voices. Amazon does not carry the restored version. We all know what Mel Gibson's voice sounds like, and listening to some bad voiceover now makes me want to puke. Please Amazon, carry the original, letterboxed version on VHS.",__label__2

The Sword in The Stone: There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times. T.H. White puts anachronisms to make it more interesting. The book was not very thrilling. The book can seem like it is never ending. But I'd say that this book is plain boring. It does have some adventure. I did not like it. I DONT RECCOMEND IT!,__label__1

"The best fantasy I've ever read.: THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is a story of the childhood of Wart, later known as King Arthur, and is filled with delightful adventures that fulfill childhood dreams-such as becoming a owl and being able to fly. Not only that,but this book is also filled with the wonder and the wisdom of T.H.White. To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy",__label__2
"The childhood of a legendary king: The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one. The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+.",__label__1
"A Waste of Time: This book was a WASTE OF MY SUMMER VACATION! I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously). He even stole some lines from Shakespeare! All he did was write it, and the writing was unbearable. Unless you enjoy mind-numbing boredom, don't waste your time on the Sword in the Stone.",__label__1

If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it",__label__1
"There's different versions of this story!: T.H.White must have published at least three slightly different versions of this story.When I read the full Once And Future King book a few years ago, there was no Madame Mim episode, there was a buttery version of the fairy castle (Robin Hood) episode, there was an Archimedes/Wild Geese episode, and some other minor changes/additions.When I read a paperback Sword In The Stone twenty years ago, there was a much nicer non-buttery version of the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode, and I don't think the Giant Galapas episode was there, etc.Now I've just read the illustrated hardcover Sword In The Stone edition, and the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode is replaced by an Anthropophagi/RobinHood episode, Giant Galapas is there, and the Archimedes/WildGeese isn't (its been replaced by an Archimedes/Athena episode).Anyone else notice these differences and have an explanation for them?",__label__2
"Thin and bends easily, but very pretty: I really liked this ring. It is very pretty and just the right size for me.The silver is very thin, however, and bends very easily. I put it on my middle finger, and when I took it off, it was bent out of shape. The good thing is that it was bent to mold to my finger and was very comfortable, even for being so wide.",__label__2
fairies dancing on my head: I found this cd on the shelf at my work. I'm listening to it right now. Sweet instrumentals that make me want to dance around. It reminds me of sugarplum fairies creating music in the 70's. The sound is light. The lyrics are few but this album isn't about the lyrics. It's about the rhythm it creates. It's a pleasant album.,__label__2
"Worth the effort it might take: Ever have one of those albums?An album where you spin it a few times and a few songs might sink-in, but the majority seem wrapped in gauze? Then-- ONE DAY -- it hits you, the genius behind the songs, the hidden melodies, the amazing musicianship?That was my experience with this album. It took 2 years of (very) sporadic listenings to suddenly be hit in the head with just how flat-out AMAZING this album is. A few songs are easy and accessible (ie. ""Captain Easychord""), while others may take a few listens to *really* appreciate--- but it's worth the effort. (as a comparison, I found ""Margerine Eclipse"" very easy to get-into, while it took a while for ""Dots & Loops"" and ""Cobra & Phases"" to really sink-in).Very highly recommended, once it hits you, it will stay with you and grow-stronger with repeat-listens.",__label__2
"A complex, multi-layered masterpiece: Unlike Dots and Loops, Sound Dust doesn't reach out and grab you at first. The album takes many listens to appreciate, but once you do, you'll realize it's a masterpiece. Microbe Hunters was the same way...hard to absorb at first, but eventually rewarding. Aside from the first track (a repetitive instrumental), every song is pure quality. Buy it, listen to it several times.....you won't be disappointed!!!",__label__2
"Not their best outting: I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday",__label__1

"disappointing: Hoover's choice of international financial manipulation as subject matter for this novel is timely and raised my expectations. Instead most of the story is pulpy romance surrounding a contrived conflict between Japanese investors scheming to revive Imperial Japan and American regulators intent on saving the free world.

"Decent shoe: Good, sturdy platform for squatting under a barbell. Very firm. Laces are long enough to wrap around ankles, and back of shoe forms a fair notch to retain the laces and keep them from sliding up and off the shoes - would have been better had there been a rear loop. Shoes are better without the insoles because they put a spongy foam wedge under the heels. I replaced them with thin flat insoles from a pair of water shoes. One could cut the foam wedge and use the included insoles. There is no raised heel other than that foam wedge. They run true to size or slightly tight.",__label__2

Fun fantasy: I love the story line of this movie - a male Fairy Godmother! What fun. And Kathleen Turner as the 'wicked witch'. What a fairy tale concept.,__label__2
"Make a wish!: 'A Simple Wish' is a cute, fun family film. It's about a young girl named Annabel (Mara Wilson) who wishes for a fairy godmother. Her brother thinks there are no such things as fairygodmothers. Well, Annabel's wish comes half true. Instead of getting a fairygodmother, she gets a fairygodfather, instead! Anyway, soon they meet an evil fairygodmother who they try to destroy. It's very fun and really cute. I saw it on TV and it was very good. All the actors in this film give great performances, and the script is pretty good, too. I definitely recommend this film for families everywhere!",__label__2
"Family film: I did not really care for this film, though, it did have a few funny moments, a lot of the attempts at humor fell flat for me. I really like Martin Short, but didn't think he was very funny in this. It was a little corny. I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that. I also didn't like the moral behind the plot, of the wish itself--getting the little girls dad the role in the play--by using any means to sabbotage the character who had the role. I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers. I know a lot of shows do that, like Bruce Almighty, but in even that show, in the end he gave the newscaster's job back to the character that he stole it from. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",__label__1

However, the fairy godfather is not very good at magic, so he is unable to grant her wish right away, and falls afoul of a witch who wants his magic. Overall a fun film for kids, and adults might enjoy it too.",__label__2
Mara Wilson: I Love Mara Wilson she is cute and beautiful.I also loved her in Matilda. I think that Matilda was beautiful.she is a good actress.she was a cute girl in Mrs.Doubtfire.I think that she was very good at that part,__label__1
"A little of everything: The plot and cinematography of this film were above average, while other aspects were a little lackluster. The storyline was well written, and the casting was on target, however the mixture of computer graphics took plenty away from the film and cheapened it quite a bit. Quite dissapointing.You do get to see Martin Short in a most unusual role, and I'd consider this a must-see for any admirer of his antics. Robert Pastorelli (the crazed painter from Murphy Brown) plays a rather lackluster role. Kathleen Turner pulled off the typical ""Evil Witch"" role a little too well. Mara Wilson seemed to do a better job in ""Matilda,"" but she was good in this film nontheless.I happened to get the Italian version of this film (alternately titled ""Un Semplice Desiderio"") and I will add that watching this movie with Italian audio on adds a little to it. Granted I may have never even seen this film if it werent in a lot of videos I bought from ebay.it :)",__label__2
A must see!: This movie is very entertaining to both adults and children. It is a fun and witty movie that you can watch again and again and still have a good time with! I would highly reccomend getting the video,__label__2

"Happy Escapist: Call me an escapist, but I love this book. To accompany Mr. Pidgeon as he builds the Islander and sails her around the world, from one adventure to another, is a wonderful way to spend a snowy evening by the fire. He gives us a great glimpse into the flavors of the various south sea island groups in the early 20th century, where most cultures were dilluted already, but a few were intact. This book lets us see the world with wide eyed wonder through the eyes of a man with a thirst for knowledge and experience, and from the deck of a small boat.",__label__2
"A stimulating toy but a little too heavy and hard: My daughter first started reaching for this toy at about 4 months old. However, her arm control wasn't developed enough to keep her from smacking herself in the face. Not a problem with lighter toys made from softer plastic. This one is pretty hefty and I had to keep one hand on it at all times. Now, at 6 months, she's doing better and can play with it without risking a black eye.For an older baby the toy is great. I don't think she's really into the beads yet, but that will come as she grows. For now she loves the colors and shape of the toy. It's easy to grip and makes a fun sound.",__label__2
"Easy to hold rattle: This rattle is easy to hold and has an added advantage of being able to roll around the floor. This makes my grandson want to crawl after it. It's well made, makes a nice rattling sound. I would buy it again for my grandson as it is quite nice. He didn't show interest in it until about 7 months and now that he is one plays with it a bit. The only negative comment I have is that he loses interest in it after a very short time.",__label__2

Each page comes alive and one can picture his joys and his frustrations as he battles the repressive Catholic Church and the French monarchy over the publication of his books, his plays and his personal philosophy. Also, his fight for the rights of the persecuted is eloquently portrayed in the period just before the French Revolution. One also gets a glimpse of the life in the 18th century through his relationships with Fredrick the Great, King of Prussia, Madame du Chatelet his lover, and Louis XV, King of France.

"Upbeat Christmas Songs That'll Get You In The Spirit: If you don't like Kenneth Copeland, then please don't write dumb, childish reviews that have nothing to do with the product. I just had to say it. The other reviews on this CD are purely based on their personal distaste for the man behind the songs, which is not how one rightly rates a product. ANYWAY, this CD is great fun to listen to imo, whether you like/know who Kenneth Copeland is or not. Jazzy takes on favorite Christmas songs like 'Go Tell It On The Mountain' and 'Away In A Manger' make their debut here, and they're great fun to listen to. This CD has been a part of my family's Christmases since it was released in 2004, and will continue to be. Why? Because the music is good and it gets you in the spirit of Christmas, that's why!

Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo. It had them babbling like babies in minutes.

"A return to early Trout: Closer to the Truth is a cd that rekindles the emotional music of Trout Fishing in America that was prevelant in Truth is Stranger Than Fishing. Every song on Closer to the Truth is a powerful emotion. There is no bad song on this cd. The albulm starts off with Dreaming which sets the listener into a daydreaming mood and goes straight into a remeniscing melody (Old Things). A light-hearted skeptical shortly follows (Dangerous). You will be humming the chorus all day after that song. Alberta Postcard will paint you a picture and make you want to visit Canada while There You Go will bring you back to the mortality of life. The icing on the cake is the finale (The Sun the Moon and Stars). This is their best song on the CD and will bring you to tears. It took Trout 10 years to match the quality of Truth is Stranger Than Fishing, but Closer to the Truth matches it and then surpasses it in their best Adult albulm to date.",__label__2

I would have to say my favorite was ""Kopasetic"" followed closely by ""Rat Face Rudy"" and ""G Man"". I enjoyed the humor that was cleverly added to the lyrics in the latter two. Some of these songs will certainly add some ""zing"" and ""pazazz"" to your day.",__label__2

If they allowed you to have songs without commentary interruption it might be ok, or if there was any 'previously unreleased' music on it. Even if they just had the pictures, film and diary entries with the music it would be ok. But there's no reason to watch this DVD more than once if you have to listen to all the commentary each time. The Band of Gypsy DVD has two options, Concert Footage only and Concert Footage with Commentary. Jimi's music speaks for itself, and no one can come close to him, so it's not necessary to hear what people have to say about him.

Well...that must have been a very thin year for Edgar nominees. This book was a severe letdown. Totally unbelievable and it got sillier and more ridiculous the more pages I read. Honestly, I can't believe Bayer would even want this one still in print. His other novels, and the ones he has written as David Hunt, are very good. But this one reads like the work of an amateur by comparison. Give it a miss.",__label__1
"Innovative design, excellent execution ...: I am a sometime amateur turner, but due to my work situation, unfortunately I spend much more time reading about turning than turning. Not good. Gotta get that fixed.So, I've read some of the best (Raffan, Darlow, etc.), but I fould Chapman's book truly inspirational. It includes information on techniques, of course, but in doing so, seemingy inadvertently showcases a wide variety of very, very good design executed very, wery well. More importantly, from my viewpoint, almost all appears to be well within the range of an intermediate turner. Recommended!",__label__2
"one of the worst books I ever read: I tried to read this book when it first came out. I couldn'tfinish it. There seem to be at least three themes or storylines in here struggling to get out. One seems to be a reasonably good alternative-history novel based on the idea that the pirate subculture of the 1700s might have formed a revolutionary constitutional regime. Unfortunately, this quickly becomes mixed up with maundering about certain ancient ""cities of the red night"" and a very great deal of homosexual imagery and fantasy. As the book goes on (as far as I read it, anyway) the main storyline becomes increasingly lost. I ultimately found it both distasteful and so muddled as to not be worth it.",__label__1
"wow, what a mess: If you read the Beats and about the Beats, you're eventually going to come to William S. Burroughs. He's very much a voice of the 1950s, post World War II. He was into the drugs, longer and harder and deeper than anyone else. He was into shocking the squares and living off the pathetic working class zombies. And it's all there on the page, man. A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story.",__label__1
"Get Out of the Defensive Position: Cities of the Red Night is William Burrough's magnum opus, the most sublime manefestation of his genius. From the opening chapter titles and hallucinatory invocation to the exquisitely fashioned closing dream sequence, each word bears the stamp of the studiously enigmatic visionary stylist. This novel impressed itself to the point that I met one of the characters in a dream, a truly disorienting experience. Sure, it's disjointed. Innoculation to the parasitic authority of the word virus, to see and feel in another medium, whaddaya think the poor guy's tryna say here, anyways?",__label__2
"strange incomprehensible mess: I've never read anything by William S Borroughs, and after finishing ""Cities Of The Red Night"" I don't believe I ever will again! What a strange befuddling mess, I challenge *anyone* to be able to summarize the plot of this book for me in plain-sense English language and actually make sense. This is just a loosely-explained collection of obtuse imagery, bizarre symbolism, wandering prose, distracted dialog, and puzzling language in here....I actually wonder what brand of illicit substances the author was under the influence of when he farted out this novel. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!! That and you can hardly go a page or two without reading about either 1) shirtless adolescent boys, 2) opium, or 3) compulsive sodomy. So despite the mass confusion of his prose, I'd say #'s 1 and 3 above are why I gave the book two stars instead of just one. Cheers!",__label__1
Bleeding Gums: Fierce symbolisms that rips out the guts of whitebread America. The most profound gem is Burrough's prediction of the AIDS crisis. He was able to capture in this book the symptoms he saw develop in the homosexual underground years before it was announced to the world at large.,__label__2
Cities Of The Red Night: Cities Of The Red Night is one of the most enjoyable books I have read. The novel has different storys that as the novel progresses intertwine. The books presents situations that are unbelievable but because of Burroughs genius you are convinced of that they are happening in a world not too far from are own. I think he was trying to show the questionableness of what is presented to us as reality. This book also has some of the most vivid pictures and unforgetable lines that I have read. It is Burroughs masterpiece.,__label__2
Need to understand German: Stephan Sulke is one of Germanys songwriters and story tellers. Unless you understand the german language you will not have the privilege to enjoy his music and lyrics to the fullest. The songs on this album are truely some of his best. Comming out of the artists heart and life the storys behind the songs have a bitter humor. i can only recomend this cd.,__label__2

"One's own dreams are better than this!!!!!: This book is not one that you quickly get through. It is very slow and dull in both story content and happenings involved. I would not and have not recommended the book since I purchased it. Actually, I threw the copy I purchased out because I did not want to subject anyone else to the boredom! If you are one that likes slow moving and unreadable books, then this is the one for you. I did not find it the list bit funny or have any true emotion over the book at all -- except for the fact that it is a waste of money!",__label__1
"The Best!!!: I agree with everyone else, Rashel Jordan(the Cat) is definately an awesome character. Off all the nightworld books, this is my second favorite. Rashel is bull-headed and will not be dominated, but it is amusing to see her get knocked off her feet by her soulmate Quinn.",__label__2
Loved It!: I really loved this book! It has my second favorite pair of soulmates in it (Ash & Mary-Lynette being my favorite). This book reminds me a lot of my favorite show 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. I think they even mention the movie in the book... Anyway this book up there with my top 5 favorite L. J. Smith books. They are all so good that it is hard to decide an exact order. so if you haven't read it yet then I suggest that you do.,__label__2
"Wonderful and Dramatic: Basically, Rashel is searching for the vampire who killed her family when she was a child. She comes upon an enclave of vampires, and, ironically, falls in love with one. His name is Quinn. He is also the fosterling of the vampire who killed Rashel's family.Well written and suspensefu",__label__2
"This book is good but I wouldn't call it great.: I liked Rashel and Quinn, they really go together. It was cool how she hunted down vampires and killed them. I loved it when they burned down the house.",__label__1
"Rashel: Ugh, I don't get it how all these people can like Rashel. To me she was an extremely annoying person because it always seemed like she was bragging about her ""amazing fighting abilities"". Also, she would always make these ""quips"" that were supposed to make her seem tough, impressive, and heroic but just made me feel like once again she was being annoying. The bad thing is that she is like this the entire book. The book has a nice plot and everything but if I can't stand the main character then that just ruins everything. Sorry.",__label__1
"read mi review. sorta like ads.: this book rocks, people! however, i got reali confused withnyala's character. what's up with her aniway? split personality?aniway, i reali loved rashel and quinn though they were always at each other's throats!! enjoy this book! p.s : if u're reading these reviews to decide whether it's worth ur money, i tell ya, get it QUICK before it's all gone!",__label__2
It was the best Night World book!: Compared to all the night world books this one is the best! I love how Rasheal is so brave and finds her soulmate while fighting vampires.,__label__2
"Randy is a dog's best friend...: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. There are few people I have encountered that are as dedicated to a cause as Randy seems to be. His devotion and tenacity are to be commended. He is doing such a great service to the city of St. Louis. There are a lot of us out there that would've never even realized there was such a stray problem in this country. I am so glad to have read this book and to be more informed on the conditions these dogs have to live in. It has been said over and over about this book, but the prevailing message is that one man can make a difference and seeing that proven in Randy's case is a great motivator for the rest of us. For anyone who loves dogs and/or loves inspiring stories, read this book.",__label__2
"A Must Read!: Enter one very unlikely hero who is trying to call national attention to the scourge. Randy Grim was young, hip, but crippled by panic attacks and phobias (of public places, parties, elevators, driving). After rescuing his first street dog, Bonnie, he couldn't look away. ""How can I?"" he asks. ""Each one says, `Don't leave me here.'"" And so the man who must pop Xanax to walk through an airport refuses to leave a starving, terror-stricken German Shepherd on a dark, icy and stormy East St. Louis street, even when an threatening tenement resident has him on the business end of a gun.Journalist Melinda Roth puts a human, and animal, face on an ignored tragedy playing out in our cities. She gives us beautifully wrought, but too few, scenes of redemption.",__label__2
"truly beautiful: Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy. Madame Curie and her husband Pierre exemplify the meaning of the word integrity - a rarity, especially in our culture of constantly searching for fame and wealth at all cost. I will read this book multiple times like visiting a friend and learning a bit more about this remarkable person each time.",__label__2
"Marie Curie - An Inspiration for All: The book is a reprint of the biography written by Marie Curie's daughter, Eve Curie in 1937. It is a book which should be read by all - especially aspiring scientists. Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband, Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium, something which would have made them very wealthy, she said ""No, It would be contrary to the scientific spirit."" How refreshing, since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries.",__label__2
"Great Book for Young Women: Excellent work by a woman writer who is also the daughter of Madam Curie. I would recommend this book to all young women. It is an excellent account of a great woman who made a mark on history when (supposedly) women had little freedom or power. Miss Curie (the writer) exhibits a great deal of love and devotion to her mother, yet remains objective.",__label__2

But this stiletto sharp Southern gal can also laugh at herself and she'll make you laugh until you're breathless. George W haters will be thrilled to know she hates the sight of him. Nor does she align herself with anti-intellectual cornpone GOPS. She calls herself Conservative, but a woman who spurns (and hates) marriage and motherhood is radical in my book. She's the perfect antidote to a sea of mushy self-esteem/body image/self-help/Chicken Soup for the Soul BS. I don't agree with everything she says, but she gives me a helluva intellectual workout.

Great Alaska singers: JoAnn and Monte are two of the best Alaska singers I have ever heard. Back in the early 80's we purchased some tapes from their show in Juneau and are sorry to find out that we can't get CD's now. It seems that nobody carries updated versions that are truly some of the best Alaska folk songs. I was thrilled to get this CD and wish I could find more.,__label__2
"Film fails to capture the magic: The quality of filming is so poor, the beauty of the music and the singer are lost. I saw the ""30's version of this as a child, and I wish I could get that....this was a real disappointment. Munsel sings beautifully, but the film itself is boring, and the quality is poor. Unless you really, really love Munsel and the music, don't buy this film.",__label__1
"Better than Therapy: Try this album after a rough day at work. Or better yet, while you're at work. More Eno-esque than Eno himself! This collection brings together the very best elements of Eno's Ambient Music work into clear, crystaline jems of structure. Each piece has a strict internal logic. Progressions and patterns grow organically, following the rules of nature - they feel like branches and leaves growing from a stem. Primarily synthesizers and lush vocal samples combine then dissipate into silence, as indeed they must. The pieces are rhythmic, with deceptively simple, yet haunting melodies. These guys have been producing some of the best Ambient music since the mid 90s. Hard to find, but worth the effort.",__label__2

Love these puzzles: I have purchased several M&D puzzles for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves putting them together. Very durable and colors are so vibrant.,__label__2
"Poor quality for the money: For the cost, this puzzle is not well made. The pieces were locked together so firmly that the puzzle was very difficult to get apart. The edges had visible splinters, and over the course of a few days, the tray warped to the point that it doesn't sit flat on a table. The edges of the image on the pieces began to fray immediately as the puzzle was taken apart. To make the puzzle usable, I had to spend 15 minutes sanding the interlocking edges, placing a slight bevel on the bottom of each piece. I then rubbed a white crayon on each edge surface. This made the puzzle easy to work for my 2 year old grand daughter. On the plus side, the image is bright and colorful, and the puzzle is simple enough for a toddler to work. Considering that the puzzle is made in China and probably cost next to nothing to produce, they could have spent a few minutes finishing the edges of the pieces and lacquering the image so that it is more durable.",__label__1
Melissa and Doug Playful Pets Jigsaw puzzle 12 pieces: Puzzle is big and colorful and interesting to look at. Purchased it for when my 2 year old grandson comes to visit. He loves it!

Wood chips off: The pieces of this puzzle are definitely no for kids..or even adults.Its made of poor quality wood and easily chips off.It chips off into such small pieces that can easily embed in anyone skin or even be eaten out of curiosity.Did not expect it from a M@D toy,__label__1
"This product should be recalled: Please don't give this to your children.It is a nice puzzle with fun colors and pictures at first sight. But it was made of layered wood, and the edges of each piece are full of splinters. I got two splinters into my fingers by just taking the pieces apart (not to mention how tight it is). I can not imagine how the little ones play with it. It will absolutely hurt their soft hands.Sorry to give this negative review. The design of this product is good, but two things have to be done to make it acceptable: 1. polishing the edge; 2.making it less tighter.",__label__1

Fun Jigsaw!: I was troubled over what to get my son for Christmas this year but when I came across this jigsaw I knew my search had come to an end.

"Not recommanded: After reading the other review I baught this puzzle for my son. I have had this puzzle for about a week now, and prob. going to have to toss it. As if with the tightness mentioned in the other review isnt already frustrationg enough, The puzzle pieces are made with layerd wood and taking the puzzle apart made the peices crack&chip and now have little wood peices all over the floor, and some pictures started to peel off. With all this going on I dont think it is save now with the sharp corners and most likely splinters coming soon and if your child is still randomly putting stuff in his mouth still, then he might choke or cut himself. Short to say dont buy, waste of money and time.",__label__1

In my case, I purchased two, and had to return them both, since neither was recognized by my computer. Although the seller took them back for full credit, it's still a hassle, and a disappointment that it didn't do what was hoped it would. The rating doesn't necessarly rate the product, since it couldn't be rated because it was not compatable, it's more towards the lack of documentation regarding compatability.",__label__1
"Didn't Work: Despite being a PC133 slot, this chip didn't work with my computer... when I put it in, the computer wouldn't boot, when removed, it booted fine... Other RAM works fine... I've used many Kingston products and this is the first time I had any problems...",__label__1
Excellent buy and compatibility: I needed to upgrade from 128 MB to 512 MB. The memory got to my home through UPS (plus a dog bone for my dog) within about 5 days. Installed easily once I figured out where HP had the memory on the motherboard (behind the drive chassis!). Everything is working like a champ. Excellent buy and compatibility for an upgrade.,__label__2
Doesn't work in anything I put it in.: I have nothing good to say about Kingston memory. I tried installing this module in an E-machines T1220 1.2 GHz Celeron system that is only 3 months old and no go. Wouldn't work in two other systems I tried. The same spec memory from Centon and PNY both worked without any problems. Mine is going back.,__label__1

Kingston technical support confirmed that thiswas high density memory and would not work in my PC.When I asked them to swap it for standard memory, theresponse was that I bought the wrong memory, and itwasn't their problem to exchange it to make it work.I'll not buy Kingston products again.",__label__1
"Over 1,000 models referenced: This book really takes me back to my childhood. Seeing the prices, my only wish is that I had kept some of these pristine in the box rather than building, trading and ultimately losing track of them.The emphasis here is on figure, theme and specialty modles rather than the standard cars and military models. Covering the '50's-'70's; Sci-Fi, horror, movie, TV and hot rods are the popular subjects here.For each model there is a color photo of the box and sometimes a built model, manufacturer, date, scale and estimated value boxed or built. There is also a brief history of model manufacturing.There are nearly 1000 models here including my favorites, those wacky cars of George Barris and Ed Roth. This is a great guide for the serious collector or someone who just wants to reminisce about those hours of model building fun.",__label__2

Hilton violates cardinal rules of a good novel and still somehow turns out a work that wrenches my frozen heart.Must be something in the manner of the telling.If you like this story, you'll love Hilton'sRandom Harvest, or his more famousLost Horizon: A Novel(BTW, in both cases, avoid the movies --terrible, terrible flops!)",__label__2
"Save Your Money!: As an incurable Beatle-maniac, I looked forward to hearing some of the cuts on this cd. BIG disappointment!! All of the songs are remakes of the original versions, and bad ones at that! None of the original Peter & Gordon or Billy J Kramer versions here. To make matters worse, the remakes are not even faithful to the originals, in some cases not even sticking to the original melody as written, but going off on interpretive ""tangents""!! Example: I hardly recognized ""Bad To Me"" as done here. Save your money, it's not even worth the curiosity value.",__label__1
"Don't bother: A huge Beatles fan who stumbled across this at the CD gift shop at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I actually think this is (was) a great idea for a CD......but this particular production is horrible. They should have tried to keep the songs in the contemporary period they were written. Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on ""Please Please Me"", and remixing them to fit the style of ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Peppers"". Oh, and it doesn't help that the band they used sucked too. I can think of about a dozen Beatles tribute bands out there that maybe could have done this properly....these guys are BAD. Don't waste your money.",__label__1
AWFUL!: Fazzari massacres these compositions. He can't sing. Plain and simple. The band should be ashamed of themselves. Listen to the samples. They'll make you angry. Total garbage.,__label__1
"Don't!: It would have been more honest if these players had just presented this disc as their own interpretations of these fine songs. These songs do NOT sound as though the Beatles were doing them. Any creditable musicians with genuine love for the early Beatles sound and atmosphere could have done a better job recreating these numbers, if that was the desire. For a good comparison, listen to ""That Means A Lot"" done by Billy Sullivan (not half so well known as Vinny Fazzari), on his ""All American Popster"" album -- exquisite!",__label__1

SHE WORKED LIKE A MAD WOMEN TO GET HER VOICE IN CHECK AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB. SHE HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER. SHE HITS NOTES ON THIS SOUNDTRACK THAT I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HER DOING. NO SHE ISNT BROADWAY TRAINED LIKE THE ORIGINAL STAGE VETS BUT SHE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB. I LUV THE ORIGINAL ASWELL BUT SHE DOES ADD A CERTAIN EMOTION THAT WAS MISSING FROM PATTI AND JULIES PERFORMANCES. SHE EVEN WAS TRAINED BY PATTI LUPONES VOICE TEACHER. SO YOU HATERS JUST OPEN YOUR MINDS A LITTLE AND GET PASS THE POP ICON THING. THE GIRL DOES HAVE TALENT.,__label__2
The poorest of all the versions to date.: I borrowed a friend's copy and listened to this version. Madonna has a beautiful voice but it is too light for this role. Antonio Banderas is woefully inadequate in the singing department. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this recording. Buy the original Broadway cast C.D. with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin. It is by far the best version.,__label__1
"Stuck in my head forever...thanks a lot!: I'm not any sort of expert of musicals but all I know is I really enjoyed this when it came out and years later I still find myself whistling Evita songs every other day. It is memorable music and this movie/soundtrack is done in a very entertaining way regardless of how faithful it is to the original. The story itself is good but ultimately doesn't really interest me and I'm not a fan of Madonna or Antonio Whats-his-name, and Latin American politics isn't the most fascinating setting for a story, but dammit...this is just a good soundtrack and rarely is a story ever told so well with such a diverse array of music. Plus unlike many soundtracks that skip songs this one is literally THE sound track to the musical. I pushed play on the CD once while the DVD was playing and it was synchronized.",__label__2

"This album has everything a person could want in a cd!!!!!: This album has everything a person could want in a cd: beautiful singing,a great music score, and (since there was no dialog in the movie) a sense of story. Antonio Banderas is a great singer. His spanish accent makes him perfect for the part. And as for Madonna, how could anyone compare her with Patti LuPone. Madonna obviously has much more delicacy and a much sweeter voice than the Broadway Evita. If it were up to me I would give this cd 500 stars. This is my favorite cd and that is saying alot since I have over 800.",__label__2
"Lush but flawed: There is no argument that the soundtrack that this album is from is a well crafted and artistic film but unfortunately the songs have been so overproduced since the original 1976 much rawer concept album that it loses much of the ""edge"" and message.I hope it wasn't star ego that led to Madonna (playing Evita) singing ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio.",__label__1
"Evita soundtrack: I was impressed with speed of delivery, condition of product & quality of packaging for the product.The soundtrack itself is wonderful as I saw the original movie when it came out and feel Madonna & Antonio deserved a better review than they got for their performances.",__label__2
"Buy another version. Any other version.: Who told Antonio Banderas he could sing? He can't. Madonna can but could only sing this score, one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's good ones (and they are becoming rare items), if Hollywood had it lowered for her. This does spoil the balance of the musical, but Hollywood doesn't care about things like that. They also gave her a song belonging to another character which makes no dramatic sense whatsoever. Hollywood doesn't care about things like that, either.There are many recordings of the stage musical available. Buy one of those instead.",__label__1
"The worst EVITA ever: The motion picture soundtrack, yet alone the motion picture of EVITA, is terrible. Hollywood, as usual, took a wondeful piece of work (the hit musical EVITA) and butchered it to be their way. Patti LuPone is a far better Eva than Madonna, and at least you can understand Mandy Patinkin, unlike Antonio Banderos. Also, Hollywood turned the orchestrations into modern rock 'n' roll junk, when the 1979 Premiere American Recording is the way EVITA should be. So don't waste your money on the movie sountrack, and buy the Premiere American Recording instead",__label__1
"HORRIBLE: This cd is horrible Madonnas verson of Eva is terrible she should not have been allowed to screw up such wonderful songs as ""Dont Cry"" and other...i dont suggest this cd to anyone who wants to hear how the songs are suppose to be sung...if you wanna hear them the right way get Elaine Paige's version or Patti LuPone...(forgive me if i spelled her name wrong)......",__label__1
"Just Marvelous: Wow, Madonna did such a wonderful job with this. I haven't heard any of the other recordings, but Madonna had real EMOTION in her voice. I have the single-cd copy, and I'm thinking about going and buying the double one, just because it's that good. I definitely reccommend this if you're into musicals. Even if you aren't a Madonna fan, it's worth it.",__label__2
"Magnificent!: This cd is absolutely wonderful! Madonna is the best Evita out there! Compared to Patti LuPone and Julie Covington she is the only one who can actually sing! Unlike Mandy Patinki, Antonio Banderas brings emotion and power to his singing. His voice is strong but can also be soft when it should be. After listening to this cd, I am glad they did cut out certain lyrics and replaced them. Some of the lyrics from the old Evitas are too direct. Jonathan Pryce may not be the best singer on this cd, but at least his voice doesn't make you cover your ears every time he comes on. He fits the part very well if you knew anything about the real Evita and Juan Peron. Jimmy Nail is also a good singer, although unfortunately he is only in 3 tracks. This cd is absolutely gggrrreeeaaattt!!!! They tried and they were more than 100% succesful!!!",__label__2
"Blue Color: I didn't like installing this printer at all. It was recommended above the Lexmark I use at work and was looking to buy, by the sales person and I should have gone with the Lexmark. The first time it didn't install and when I tried to remedy the problem, following the directions exactly, it crashed my entire system. It took me 3 days and a lot of time with the tech to correct the problem and I am still having errors. Maybe it's because I run Windows ME but this printer has been a complete disaster. I also don't like the color quality. It reads color much darker than what's on the screen and everything has a very blue tint. I will be replacing this printer as soon as I can with a Lexmark.",__label__1
"Have not received my item in a month.: My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month.",__label__1
"Good Buy: This printer has not caused my any troubles to this date. It's a quality little printer, as all HP products tend to be. The quality is good, but not great. This is an ideal printer for the casual user at home or office. The connection is USB, so the setup was easy. This printer also works well on my home network. If you need a good quality printer at a good price, the deskjet 825c would be an excellent choice.",__label__2
Magenta: This thing is awful. Prints magenta only. Drives me crazy. I am going to go find a high building to throw it from.,__label__1
"Constant paper jams: I had no expectations for print quality with a printer at this price, but expected something that worked. EVERY attempt to print either jammed the printer or ripped the paper. I attempted to print with newly opened reams ranging from low end generic copy paper to Epson photo paper with consistent results. If you do decide to buy, 1) ensure the store will accept returns, and 2) be prepared to pay return shipping.",__label__1
"limitations of color printing: This printer works great for almost any application, but do not expect to print on special paper. On even the soft gloss paper, the ink blobs and gives poor quality printing. The color photos print better on regular paper than on photo or special finish paper. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING, you will be disappointed.",__label__1
This is so useful: I have had my handbook for a few years and this book has helped me with a bunch of papers for college.,__label__2
"Definitely Brief: I do like the book and use it alot for school. The part that I use most is the Directory of Words Cited. Unfortunately, many times the exact type of work to be cited is not listed. For instance, a book with an editor in multiple volumes in an edition other than the first is not covered. Neither is an article from a journal obtained from a database.",__label__2
"Not pleased with Express delivery!: My review is not about the book. This is one of my textbooks I needed for my course and I was glad that Amazon had it in stock. However I chose to pay highest shiping amount to express delivery for next day, (which happens to be Saturday) so that I have time to review chapter before school started, it did not arrive that Saturday. What is purpose was next day delivery if you don't receive the product on time? I think I paid about $25 for one book when there was an option to receive Monday delivery for much less ($10, I think). The book arrived on Monday after my school started and I did not have a book to take to school. Amazon owes me money!",__label__1
"The same bootleg nonsence: First of all, let me say that I am a huge Wes fan! Not only is he one of my favorite guitarists, but one of my favorite composers as well. Everything Wes played was genius, including all the music on this CD. However, this release is not worth buying.This CD follows in the long tradition of Wes bootlegs of the March 27, 1965 concert in Paris. The songs are mistitled, the sound quality is poor; the personal are not listed, the date is not listed, the venue is not listed, and the booklet is non-informative. To make matters worse the song order has been rearranged to an awful order!If you are interested in obtaining a good version of this concert buy ""Quintessential Wes"" by Varese Records.",__label__1
"Terrible: It came eith a hole, so from day 1 i couln't use it without a patch, and i had to buy another patch because this one didn't work either",__label__1
"Came with a Leak: Guess I knew we were gambling when we bought this, since about half the existing reviews said it arrived with a leak. Remind me to never to go Vegas, right? It arrived, we blew it up with the built-in pump, which worked like a charm. Seemed like it was pretty comfortable... then my son took it on a sleepover, and woke up the next morning flat on the floor. Returned it to Amazon as a defective item for a full refund. Thinking I like another reviewer's idea of just buying a regular twin-size mattress, since we would usually be using it at home anyway, then maybe get one of the pump-less airbeds for the occasional road trip, since those have better reliability stats than the ones with the built-in pump. Live and learn...",__label__1
Used it once before it broke: I bought this for my 9 year old to sleep on. We used it the first time and everything was fine. Pulled it out a month later and it has a slow leak somewhere that I can't find to repair. Basically a waste of $35. I guess you get what you pay for.,__label__1
"Disappointment: I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money.",__label__1
SEVERAL LEAK VERY SOON: The price is great. The bed looks good. I have ordered several over the last few years. I've only had 2 last 6 months or longer_ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving---2 days after the return policy. All I can say is if you need it- order 2; because it's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon. Unless you only use it occassionally. I use mine every day.,__label__1
"A great buy!: I love this air mattress! Very easy to set up and put away and very comfy to sleep on. I have slept on other air mattresses before and this is by far the best one I have ever slept on. The soft top makes it so you don't feel like you're sticking to it, but I put a blanket over it anyway for extra comfort. I have been recommending this one to all of my friends, I'm very happy with it!",__label__2
"Doesn't hold air: I bought this air mattress to use while my new bed was being shipped from back east, the bed lost air every night and I woke up almost on the floor. I tried to send it back but it was impossible to get back into the box.",__label__1
"If you buy this, good luck.: We purchased the Intex Inflatable twin bed with built in pump. After a few uses it started leaking air. By the middle of the night, it was down to about half full. So, being we are out of the 30 day return time frame, we are just out.If you buy this, good luck.",__label__1
"Horrible product: Using this air bed was a nightmare to my husband. It is not firm and loses air easily. It lost half of the air in 30 minutes. When my husband got up from this bed in the morning, he was almost on the floor. He slept as a curve during the night, which really hurt his waist, which affect his movement. Definitely will return to Amazon today.",__label__1
"Did not hold air. I have to return it!: This looked like a good produce and inflated easily, but would not hold the air. I am very upset that in returning, I will not get full refund for this defective product! There will be a restocking charge, which is rediculous because they can't sell a defective product!",__label__1
"Utter Garbage: Dear potential sucker,My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week, so I obtained a refund. I bought this model next, and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third. I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State",__label__1
"This is a horrible bed: I bought this bed at the end of May so that I would have an air mattress available if a guest were to stay. I first took it out of the box it was shipped in more than a month after it arrived and set it up the day before my guest was to arrive. It sat in an unoccupied room for one night- no one slept on it at all and lost substantial amounts of air. A serious amount air leaked out- it was visibly noticeable. I cannot imagine how much air would have leaked had a person slept on it. This is a horrible product. It was past the 30 day refund from Amazon and after being on hold for over 20 minutes waiting to speak to an Intex rep, I gave up. You are seriously throwing your money away if you purchase this item. It was never slept on- period- and is unusable.",__label__1
"Seams Came Apart After 5th Use: I bought this to sleep on while I moved it to my new place and used it about 6 times before the seams on top came apart. I never realized how important the seams were until that dreary night when at 3am they started to come apart. I turned to my side and another came apart. I turned to my other side and the rest came apart (I weigh 120 lbs if it matters)which turned the bed into one giant ball. Since the seams are gone there is no shape and if you lay on it the air is distributed to the opposite of your weight...I ended up in a hammock type pose. I let some air out in hopes it would bring the top down but nope, instead I sunk further.I called the manufacturer, emailed Amazon for the contact info to be sure, emailed the manufacturer again and finally got a response. Although some models come with a 90 day warranty, this one did not so I was SOL.Never again. Buy yourself a cheap mattress instead, at least it won't break and the comfort will be about the same.",__label__1
"Disposable item; will not last past 6 months.: So I've had this product since July 2011, and it is now in the trash. The seams do not hold up and 2 have released, creating giant 'bubbles' in the mattress rendering it unusable. I paid nearly $50 for this back then, and only used it 3 or 4 times. Very disappointed in the poor quality of this item.",__label__1
"All of mine have not lasted long.: A comfortable bed for the money. But I've had 7 or 8 of these, and they ALWAYS fail in one of two ways:1) An external seam will break, usually near the head area. To fix it, use a good size piece of Gorilla Tape (forget the enclosed repair kit) and press down very hard around the leak so no air can get out. No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center. No way to fix that, unless you want to use pillows or folded blankets to level out the low areas.That's my advice. I'm still looking for a good, sturdy alternate model.",__label__1
"Would not inflate RETURNED: I've bought several air beds from various manufacturers. I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago. It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months. I justified this as the user may have not taken care. However, I now believe its the brand. This one would not inflate at all. I will not buy this brand again. I've had great life from a better brands.",__label__1
Terrible beds: I ordered these beds because my grandkids were sleeping on the floor and couldnt afford real beds and in less than 2 months both beds have popped. They didnt jump on them they just lost air seemed like the seams were the problem. 1 bed was replaced but the other remains not replaced. I would never buy these type of beds ever again or this brand. They were not cheap and I cant afford to replace them again. So now they are back to sleeping on the floor again. I heard they were good or I would not have ordered them. I am terribly disappointed.,__label__1
"Will not completely deflate: I ordered 3 of these. They are sturdy, comfortable, and stay inflated. The electric motor in each easily and quickly inflates and (almost) deflates them. The height also makes them feel more like a real bed.However, if you want to completely deflate them for storage, that can be a real trick. I could never deflate any of them completely, so in frustration I cut one open to see what the problem is. A design flaw allows an internal plastic flap to cover the deflation port when they are almost empty. The more you try to vacuum or squeeze out air, the tighter the flap seals the port, sealing in the last bit of air.Now I know, and there's nothing I can do about it, but I feel better after attacking one with scissors...",__label__1
Waste of Money: I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and didn't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this. within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is..we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well. The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now. I also don't like the top it not comfortable with the humps.,__label__1
"convenient twin airbed: First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days. Super convenient to have the built in electric pump and super fast to inflate. Takes a bit of an effort to deflate, but that is expected for pretty much any airbed.",__label__2
"It could be better: Currently, there are no wholes throughout the bed. But, for some reason when I wake up. The bed is already out of air. I only weigh 120lbs. I don't understand why it does that. Please save your money, when you start to have the same problem.",__label__1
"One Was Good, So I Bought Another-Big Mistake: I purchased the first airbed and found it to be exactly what I wanted. I ordered and received a second one which I have not yet used. Meanwhile, the first one has sprung a leak and is not usable. Big disappointment. No reason for leakage as it has been used only for small individuals.",__label__1
Well made and great value!: We had guests that used it last weekend. They said it felt like a real bed. I was so suprised on how quickly it inflated and deflated. The cord hides away in a handy compartment. It keeps its air pressure. No need to carry around a separate pump. Our dog wanted to adopt it as her own bed. The dog jumped on it and tested it toughness. It passed with flying colors.,__label__2
"Outstanding Bed: I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!",__label__2
"Worst airbed ever - Don't buy: If I could give a 0 star I would.So I bought this airbed while I had a friend visiting so she could use my bed. It seemed to work just fine the first night. However the second time I inflated this bed and slept on it, I got the worst night of sleep ever. During the night, the air slowly came out of the bed (I have checked all over for leaks or holes but could not find anything). I woke up several times to a half inflated bed and then had to re-inflate the bed again only to wake up an hour later to the same condition. Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with the product. Hope Amazon will let me return this terrible thing.",__label__1
inflatable airbed: very happy with this electric pump inflatable airbed - understandable directions -very easy to inflate with electric pump - confortable to lie on especially withheadrest - easy to store with its own bag - I'm entirely satisfied with thisproduct from Amazon,__label__2
"RETURNED IT!: We purchased this bed for an extra for when the kids come over. Nice looking, but don't let looks deceive you. By the morning, you won't have any air in your bed.",__label__1
"Lasted a month: It actually lasted a whole month until it decided to deflate and go flat. I guess I am just hard on blowup beds.I was using it every day as a regular bed, perhaps it would be better if used for visitors only.",__label__1
"Easy to setup and comfortable: I got this for guests to use in our small spare room. Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints.",__label__2
"I love this bed! carry it anywhere!: I was little apprehensive before buying an airbed thinking how it would be. But this turned out real nice one. It doesn't need you to call U-haul when you move out. It doesn't require much space to carry it with you anywhere you go. Its also really easy to inflate with the electronic pump and even easier to deflate naturally. After you get used to the ""airbed"", it feels like a normal bed. It offers a great option for people who don't want a hassle of carrying mattress and other accessories along with the trouble of carrying them.It also doesn't require you to carry your pillow. The top surface is velvet like thing that is so soft, you could do w/o a bed sheet also.go for it, if you need one.",__label__2
"Huge disappointment: I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away.",__label__1
"Impossible to keep sheets and mattress pads on.: Everyone who slept on this mattress, ended up with a jumble of bedding after a few tosses and turns. I would not recommend it.",__label__1
"I couldn't find the leaks.: When it started leaking I couldn't find the leaks. First the top started leaking, later the bottom so now I have totally given up on it.It was comfortable before it started leaking.",__label__1
"Nice: I have not completely set this item up yet, but thus far looks like a great mattress for extra sleeping accommodations. Is for my college-age son via family visits....",__label__2
"Thank you for saving my back!!!: I ordered this air mattress because I have a bad back and was getting another procedure done and needed a place to recover. We already have a Queen-size air mattress but have space limitations so this was a perfect fit in more ways than one. As always, the customer service with Amazon was wonderful and they got it to me in time, and now I sleep on this air mattress more than my real bed! It is comfortable and actually helps when my back is acting up and it is the only place that I am able to find relief. So thank you for a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone. The air stays in and it is easy to inflate and deflate. The price is also great as well. I can think of many reasons why this would be a purchase that is more than worth it for people of all ages (I am in my forties).",__label__2
"Comfortable, but leaked the first night: it inflated easily and was very firm, by the morning i noticed it was considerably softer, and as i sit here now typing this i find myself gradually getting closer to the floor. easy enough to reinflate, but still, this should not happen the first night.",__label__1
Great buy!: This bed worked great for when I had company over. I needed something that was easy and compact so I can store it when it's not needed. I like having the pump built in because there's no chasing the thing around when you need to use the bed again.,__label__2
Didn't Last: I bought this for my 8 year old to sleep on in temporary housing during a corporate move. This bed didn't last two days and it came apart in the seam where we couldn't patch it. I would not waste my money on this product again.,__label__1
Perfect for grandchildren: We always have lots of grandchildren around and they are getting older so this bed comes in handy. Because it is raised up it is easier for me to put sheets on. So glad I tried it.,__label__2
Guests love it.: Inflates fast. Nice shape when inflated stores well. Guest are getting a good nights rest. Would reorder if we need more.,__label__2
"Comfortable: Is comfortable to sleep on,it fills up fast and easy. Only thing really don't like is the rubber smell it has when u first open it but little by little it goes away. I recommend it 100%.",__label__2
"quality: I liked this, my guests said it was comfortable. It stayed inflated for the 7 days of guests and no one complained about it.",__label__2
Good buy: I've had this for 3 months now and it gets used about once a week and so far has held up well. So easy to use and takes no time at all. I would recommend this product.,__label__2
"Not Happy: I used the bed 3 nights and it started leaking on the fouth night. I contacted the seller and was told to find the leak. If it was in a seam it was under warranty. I tried to find the leak, but was unable. I emailed them back to ask the best way to find the leak. I received NO response.I did a little reasearch on the web and found MANY people had a problem with this bed.So I am unable to find the leak and unable to use the bed.I an not Happy with the company I purchased if from and will not recommend them to anyone!",__label__1
"Not all air beds are created equal: I purchased the Intex airbed to replace an Aerobed that our cats ""loved"" too much during a guest visit. Comfort wise, the Intex wins hands down-supportive yet comfortable as well. Convenience wise, it inflates a little slower than our old Aerobed (albeit, there is more to inflate) yet it takes up less room when rolled and stored in the sack that comes with it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is VERY high, so a restless sleeper can fall off pretty easily.",__label__2
"air mattress: So far so good....holds the air and prefect for a sleep over at aunties's house!Easy set up,built in pupmp, easy put away....nice carrying bag also.So far worth the money, Thank you.",__label__2
"Great Airbed: I looked at several airbeds before buying this one. I looked at several name brands, I was not familiar with Intex so I checked the reviews and am glad I did. Fast delivery, easy set up (a must for me) and a very sturdy product. We are completely satisfied with this bed. The built in pump is easy to use and works perfectly. We bought the twin due to space but intend to buy a larger bed to have on hand.",__label__2
"huge LUMP after a few uses...: i only used this bed about a dozen times. it was never really all that comfortable and the last time i inflated it, a huge lump developed right in the middle making it unusable. there is no way to get rid of the lump and it is rock hard solid. it raised up about 3 inches high and is about 15 inches in diameter. its too late to send it back now so its going in the dumpster. i have since read other reviews of intex doing the same thing. i will NEVER get another intex again...i am going back to aerobeds!",__label__1
"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: I looked around before buying an airbed. Saw many options and compare. Many different comments that confused me.

Easy to store in the morning. 5 star product.",__label__2
"Fast, Easy, Comfortable, Great for Guest: Fast Blow-up, Easy to handle, Comfortable, Not too big & not too small - great for Guests. Only 4 out of 5 because it looses about 15% of the air originally put in within 2 days. I still recommend this product to anybody!",__label__2

on website it says twin but actual size is single.: i dont know why these guys are trying to cheat. i paid full amount and i was expected to receive a twin size airbed but when i opened it it is actual size is single sized matress! so this company is baad! will never suggest it to someone.,__label__1

"Intex Airbed: These are only meant for use as temporary or guest bedding, but I've been in a situation where I am using this item daily as my bed for over a month now. I am a large person. It has held up beautifully. I add air maybe once every 7-10 days. The flocked top is great, holding sheets in place. It is so comfortable, my back and general body pain has improved dramatically since using it! I suspect that when my permanent bed arrives, this little bed will serve long and well as guest bedding.",__label__2
Great value: I have three of these mattresses. They are much longer lasting and more sturdy than other brands I have purchased. They are very comfortable.I highly recommend this product.,__label__2
"Great Air Mattress: For the price, it can't be beat. It's very comfortable. I ordered two so I'd have one as a backup in case one sprung a leak. I had no problems with the quality of either, although it is about 6-8"" more narrow than a standard twin so twin fitted sheets are too big.",__label__2
"Not good enough, 3 stars - got a good replacement, now 4 stars: Needs to be pumped up at least twice in the night. High rise makes it easy for older people to use.UPDATE:Amazon was outstanding. I wrote saying that the bed was leaking too much to be comfortable.. an immediate replacemnt was sent and i printed out a free shipping label online.The new bed is perfect.. three kids slept on it together and they were fast asleep when i checked later.I left the airbed out next two days and no air had leaked yet.I was lucky I think to have got a good piece.Thank you Amazon.",__label__2
losing air already!: We used the airbed for one guest (my very careful mother-in-law) over the holidays and it was fine. My son took it on a trip and it began loosing air the first night and he has not been able to use it since. I would not buy this again and in fact will try to return it when he returns home with it.,__label__1
"This thing SUCKS! I went through 3 of them!!! Waste of money. Do NOT buy this: I went through three of these, neither one of them would maintain the air pressure and would slowly deflate. This occurred within 2 uses for each of the 3 mattresses i had. I considered maybe the person sleeping on it was too heavy, but alas, the person is 210 pounds and the weight limit is 300, so that wasnt it. I thought maybe it was punctured, but if it was the person would have awoken on the floor instead of on a supper jeloutnous rubber blob, so that was not it either. What conclusion left is there- this thing sucks and doesnt maintain the air.",__label__1
"Only good for a couple of use: I bought this Intex bed for my son. He is renting an apartment while waiting for a room assignment in a dorm.The bed, although still inflates, now has a bulge in the middle, so he falls off the bed. Even though we tried deflating and inflating the same, the problem is still there.",__label__1
Excellent bed and for the price. Sets up quickly.: I was unsure what size to buy so I bought this twin size bed and then a queen size bed. The twin size (THIS BED) sets up quickly and FIRM! Whereas the queen size bed id more burdensome in size and labor. I recommend this twin size bed by Intex model.,__label__2
worthless: I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.,__label__1
Not good: It only lasted for less than 3 months then there was 2 holes that I fixed but still there was a leak somewhere and eventually I just threw it away. I don't recommend this air mattress.,__label__1
3 weeks and heard a big boom!: Heard a huge boom and I noticed the seam had given out and then this huge bubble formed in middle of the bed and then it ripped a few days later. I purchased the product on or around 10-6-2011 and before 11-1-11 it was deflated!,__label__1
"So far so good....: My brother was coming to stay for a week in our apartment, so I needed something that would not be totally uncomfortable for him to sleep on 5 nights in a row. This air mattress did the job. It did a nice job of staying inflated throughout the week. My brother actually preferred the feel of it after a couple of nights (got slightly softer due to minimal air loss). The only issue I had was not being able to get 100% of the air out of it during deflation. We used the motor to remove most of the air, but towards the end it couldn't force the rest out. I tried pressure, but it seems as if the release has to be a certain angle to let the air escape. It still folded up and fit in the bag (barely). But overall, it held air and that's what we needed it to do.",__label__2
Perfect for me: I like itI was looking for it I found it I got and I am enjoying it to the fullestI recommend it to anyone,__label__2
"Comfortable, but a little smaller then some.: I like a firm bed and found that I needed to physically pump in the additional air pressure. There is that option along with the electric/fill, deflate which is very helpful. I took it camping for five nights and though I topped it off before bed every night, it didn't deflate enough for me to notice in the morning.",__label__2
"Worth the money.: Needed place for kids to sleep while visiting grandma and now they argue over who gets to sleep on the air mattress. Both think it's more comfy than their bed at home.Would have given 5 stars, but the bag it comes with to put it in is worthless, no chance of ever getting it in there again.",__label__2
"Terrible product, I regret spending my money on this: I bought this air mattress two months ago. I used a couple of days and it worked fine. Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong, instead of a flat surface, there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again, the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it. And the company that makes this mattress says ""this product does not have any warranty or service program"". I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that won`t fail after a while.",__label__1
"Great convience for the price!!!!: Product arrived on time, (a little early actually---which is a good thing, :-); intact, & in excellent condition. This bed includes an ""in mattress inflation motorized pump"" that makes for ease of use, and much quieter inflation application in comparison to external pump air mattresses. It is comfortable, and an extremely good value for the price!!! Will purchase this product again!!!",__label__2
"item mislabeled: This is a good product. I use it nightly.It is 36"" in width, not 40"" as marked onthe box. This makes it tend to roll moreeasily. I had to frame and tie it to makeit stable.",__label__2
"A total dud: Opened the box, unrolled the mattress, plugged in the motor and then... the motor made a few feeble noises and shut off in less than three seconds. Plugged it into several different outlets with the same results.Intex customer service told me that there are NO WARRANTIES on their air mattresses and the only option was to return it to Amazon for a refund. I will not be ordering any products from Intex in the future.",__label__1
"okay for the price: I used it for a week and half and it seem to work as described. I don't know how well its going to work for over a long period of time, but it is cheap so it probably wouldn't last that long. No leakage of air or anything yet. It was the right size for me and I am 5'2, it might be small if your over 6' I'd imagine. Anyways, I recommend it to people who are looking for a temporary place to sleep.",__label__2
"Faulty advertising: At 80"" iong, this is an extra long twin, not a standard twin. Consequently I had to take back the sheets I bought, as they were 5"" too short. I would have ordered a different model had I known that 80"" wasn't standard. It's easier just to replace the sheets and I don't have time to send the bed back.",__label__1
"Angry: I bought this bed while I decided to purchase a normal bed. I was at first excited but as the week, past the seam popped and the bed now has a bubble and un-usable. for the money you pay for an air-bed I stick with a traditional bed over and air bed. Least to say thanks the quality is poor! I do not recommend.",__label__1
Crappy Air bed: Airbed doesn't keep air overnight. If you try to return it you will be charged a restocking fee to restock an airbed that doesn't work so you will get no refund.....exchange it for another crappy airbed...My recommendation is....don't buy this crappy airbed!!,__label__1
"Night on the Floor: The bed arrived much sooner than I expected, and I inflated it for w few minutes before I took it on my retreat. Imagine my surprize at having it deflate within an hour of getting is set up in my room. I ended up sleeping on the floor that night.We'll see how the return process goes. I'm headed out to buy an air mattress locally.",__label__1
"do you hear air?: This item loses air overnight. Must be inflated daily if not nightly. If you return this item the store won't take it back, you must ship to the maker at your expense. Or you must cut the air pump out because they don't trust you not to keep using it, like we have to trust them on their quality.",__label__1
"Comfortable... if not for the deflation.: I received the bed, and I loved it. But after one night it almost completely deflated. I tried to find the holes but I found none, so it was kind of a waste of money.",__label__1
"Was hopeful, but . . .: I was hopeful this mattress would work out, having read mixed reviews, but as others stated, the mattress held air for only several days before it started losing air during the night. My son would then have to turn the air pump on (during the night) in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep. Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing, as I then purchased one from the local K-mart, which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem.",__label__1
"I so wanted to love this item: Was very comfortable when I inflated it, but had deflated twice before the night was over. Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy (especially since it deflates so fast) but it is noisy,and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed? Not me, that's for sure. I really wish it hadn't been a leaker, I like this bed, everything about it except that.",__label__1
"Comfortable: We took this bed camping, and it was very comfortable to sleep on. It did lose some air overnight, so we just reinflated before going to bed. Great mattress for the price!",__label__2
Intex Twin Airbed: The two beds arrived quicker than I expected. They are very comfortable and blow up quickly. Getting all the air out to put it in its duffel bag took a little work but it fit. Easy to travel with when visiting friends.,__label__2
"Nice Bed: Seems to be a nicely designed and manufactured air bed. We've used it for guests a few times, and are pleased with it.",__label__2
"Very convenient and easy: I bought this to stay in my daughters dorm room where space is limited and it worked great. Don't need a pump its all built in. Stayed 5 nights and added air with the flick of a switch, I like it very firm. Would buy another if needed.",__label__2
bubble bed: This bed sucks after 1 month I was asleep on the bed when a popping noise woke me up I didn't know what it was so I went back to sleep when again a popping noise woke me up again I couldn't figure out what it was when I got up the following morning I noticed a big bubble going down one side of the bed that's when I realized it was the bed making the popping noise smh,__label__1
"Not as good as Aero Beds..... was disappointed: It works but the next morning it has lost some shape and isn't as comfortable as it could be. For the price and the function is okay, the twin size made it right for our allowable space - but if you will need a longer term solution it is probably better to invest in a more expensive air bed.",__label__1
"Low cost defective product: This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice.",__label__1
"Aerobed saves the day (and night) with comfortable sleep alternative!: I ordered the aerobed for visiting guests, and they loved it. Also, it fit nicely in my space-challenged unit. Shipping was great! Price was great! all happy campers.",__label__2

"Doesn't Last: We received the Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump on September 10th 2008. It is for our 8 year old daughter who has joint pain due to a genetic disorder. Her doctor recommends an air bed to relieve the pressure on her joints caused by a ""traditional"" mattress. The first 2 months it worked great. She was sleeping better and woke up in less pain. The next few months we had to pump it up every other day, but she still was in less pain. Now today, April 11th 2009, just 7 months later she can't even sleep on it. Within 3 hours the bed is almost completely flat. Our daughter is now sleeping on couch cushions until we can find a new bed. Don't waste your money on this bed! Find ANY OTHER airbed, you'll be much happier.",__label__1
"Leaked striaght frpm the box: I chose this twin air mattres becaue of the reviews and brand, good quality. I bought it about 2 months ago for a weekend of Holiness, it just had a hole when i aired it up. Threw it in the trash terrible product.",__label__1
"Intex air mattress: Used for a temporary bed when visiting relatives. Easy to set up and store. Inflates very quickly and is comfortable. I only used it three times and if it lasts a year, I'll be a happy ""camper"".",__label__2
"Comfortable but still not perfect: I have purchased this matress 3 weeks ago. The price is pretty affordable, and it actually looks like a normal bed. At the beginning it leaked a bit, but after that (I really don't know why) it was ok. It is pretty comfortable. The built-in pump works very good and very convenient in use. The only two things are that I don't like in this matress are that one side of this matress is higher by 2-3 mm than another. And when you sleep on it you feel like there is a small angle. I mean the matress is not 100% horizontal. Another thing that peaces me off is the noise that comes from the matress when you move or somehow turn over. But overall it is good substitution if you need a temporary bed.",__label__2
Intex Inflatable Twin Bed: I've only had it a little bit however many words have been written pro and con about this product so I to shall endeavor to provide you with some useful information.1st it is an airbed and it doesn't take kindly to claws of many kinds or sharp point objects. 2nd it is a portable airbed... the valve isn't a perfect seal as with any air mattress or bed so expect to use the built in pump every now and then as a result of seepage .. 3rd comfort just pump it up or deflate to personal comfort level. 4th the price is relatively low cost. 5th Seems to be of decent quality aired up right out of the box and has held the pressure with no major leaks.,__label__2
"Sized Incorrectly: I purchased 2 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Beds due to the size specifications of 40 X 80 X 18 1/2"". They were to be used by my >6 ft. tall family members when visiting. I was extremely disappointed when we inflated the 1st bed - which BARELY measured 32 X 70 X 16. I sent a letter to the supplier, CMS WorldWide Sales, explaining my dissatisfaction & was told to send pictures & measurements (which I did) and they would [quote]...""Once you had provided us the information we had requested, we will be glad to forward you the return shipping labels.""This was months ago, and to date I still have 2 Intex Pillow Rest Beds (the 2nd box was never even opened!) that are no where near the specs stated on the packaging.I will NEVER order anything from the CMS WorldWide Sales supplier again.",__label__1
"decent for price, only one fall back so far: I purchased this a couple weeks ago, and used it for the first time last night. It worked well. Plugged it in and it only took a couple min to inflate. My problem with this bed is not so much how well it works inflating but what a hard time i had deflating it this morning. I was so frustrated trying to get all the air out that i finally just wrapped it up. With even a little air still in it, it makes it so hard to roll up tightly and put away. It just looks bulky. I have tried aerobeds in the past and i love that their beds have a release valve, this one uses the a small hole built in with the pump. The release valve work much better, and I decided to go with this because it was affordable and i couldn't find aerobeds in twin size. I am definitely gonna see if i can get a return on this... i just hope i can fit it back in the box it came in.",__label__1
"misgivings: The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would- every 3 days at the most. So much so that if I didn't pump it, the bed would all be like a water bed with ""jelly-like"" feeling. To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls. Further more, what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my (head) pillow in the morning. But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold (or the air inside feels cold).What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating- although it is loud for an evening activity.",__label__1
"Great Bed @ Great Price...: I purchased this airbed because I wanted to sleep in the same room as my newborn. Yes, I'm one of those paranoid new moms. This bed goes above and beyond. I wanted to buy the AeroBed first because I'm one of those people who hates to buy cheaper items because they usually break or whatever. I'm pretty much a sucker for the theory that expensive = quality. However, I went with my gut and decided to try this airbed having never heard of the company before. Listen to your gut! It inflates in 3 minutes and deflates in about 3 minutes. If you want it to be more firm & allow the air to settle in better, you should leave it in there for about 7-10min. Not a big deal at all. Go do something in another room while you're inflating it. This thing can also handle a lot of weight. When I'm sleeping on the airbed, my husband comes in the room to tell me he wants to sleep in this bed too because it's so comfy. Great Buy!",__label__2
"not 80in in length: I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me. The description says this airbed is 40in wide and 80 inches in length. The box housing the bed clearly states the bed is 39 in wide and 75 inches long. I am really disappointed because I have been shopping for this for over 3 months and only recently decided this was the right bed. WRONG!The goal is to provide comfort. /his won't, his feet will be hanging off the edge of the bed. Its going back.",__label__1
Went flat in the middle of the first night.: This airbed does not stay inflated. It went flat half way through each of the five nights I used it. It is junk. Don't buy it. If I had bought it at a store it would have gone back the next day.,__label__1
"A little hard to fold back up but seems great otherwise: I'm arranging a getaway weekend in hotel, so I bought a bunch of these. I tried one first and it seemed nice and working as specified. The only thing is that it's tough folding and putting it back into it's bag.",__label__2
Garbage: Only used a handful of times and the bed already leaks air. Waste of money. I know it shows a one star rating but the true rating is zero stars.,__label__1
"Awesome Air Bed: This is used for when my older son has friends stay over night. It's easy to set up, and comfortable. Does the job flawlessly.",__label__2
Great: This really worked out well for me! It lost a little air but that is to be expected. I use this during the holidays when extra people are visiting.,__label__2
It must be good...: I tried it out and fell asleep on it. No noticeable leakage overnight. It seems to me like a good buy.,__label__2
One Strike: The product deflated during the night. We refilled and let sit with no one in it for a while and it still lost air. I was very disappointed as the product initially started great for my Aunt who would not have been able to be on the floor with a traditional air mattress. I am attempting an exchange hoping it was just this one item. Most of the reviews were glowing and I am hoping that the replacement will perform as the other reviews indicated.,__label__1
"No-Go,sorry: Was nice while it lasted. After a few nights on the mattress, one of the seams in the middle apparently broke. Now it's nothing but a large bubble in the center. Tried flipping it over but it's like sleeping on a rocking chair. Nothing to do but take it to the dumpster.",__label__1
"comfortable kids bed: My grandson loved sleeping on this blow up bed, he said it was so comfortable. It's a great idea if you need xtra guest beds, because it deflates and stores so easily. It takes about 3 or 4 minutes to inflate.I would recommend this product highly.",__label__2
"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed, deflating within 3 months: I had another airbed that lasted about 2 years before there was a leak and needed to replace it. This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it. I did like the airbed and it was comfortable. We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it. I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use. I used it this weekend and had to pump it up again in the middle of the night and I think my time for warranty is over with.",__label__1
"Good for its value: I bought the bed with the idea of using it during one week while my father was visiting. It fulfilled its purpose perfectly. It's comfortable, it inflates and deflates very quickly and it's pretty high. There are two reasons why I am not giving it a 5-star score: a) I used sheets and still, when I woke up, my back was sweating. I guess that it is a problem with all these beds that are made of plastic, but... that is a drawback. b) I haven't been able to fold it and fit it in the bag again, it's almost impossible.Anyway, overall, it's a great deal for its price. I would absolutely recommend it and the problems I pointed out are probably a problem in all air beds.",__label__2
"Very Comfortable: The bed is nice and soft and double thick. The auto pump is easy to use and works pretty well with new batteries. The vacuum drain does ok but when down to the base have to help it by rolling it at the end. Folding it isn't to hard and package size isn't to big so easy to store. Bed lines fit ok on it but get good one so they squeeze tight so they hang on. But for the money is a great buy I shopped around a lot target, walmart, dicks, Meijer, sears, kmart, ect. So very good buy if you want one for camping or a guest bed.",__label__2
Good!!: I like this product. The power code is nicely kept in the unit so I do not have to worry about losing the power code. Kids love it when their friends come for sleep over. Quick and easy to use.,__label__2

"Beware of the dimensions: I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80""x40""(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32""x72"". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box.",__label__1
INTEX air bed: The item arrived on time and was easy to set up. It stayed inflated the entire night and was quick to deflate the next morning. We have always been Aerobed purchasers in the past and now find this Intex to be just as good quality wise.,__label__2
"Great: This bed is great, compact and comfortable. We've had guests who use it ask us where we got it because they want to buy it too.",__label__2
"Intex Pillow Rest Airbed: This is the exact product we were looking for. It's compact, self filling, and pretty comfortable. It's perfect for traveling or when company spends the night. It provides the extra sleeping accommodations we needed. The 120v pump fills the bed quickly. The battery pump or foot pump wouldn't have worked well for us.",__label__2
It doesn't stay firm even overnight.: It doesn't stay firm even overnight. The motor burned out after a while. I bought a Coleman. . . .,__label__1
"Short Product Life: This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price. The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use. The seam design is flawed, which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern. The return shipping and 50% refund potential make recovering any money impossible. I got some use out of the bed, but definitely wouldn't buy anything else from this manufacturer.",__label__1
"Terrible product and customer service: I purchased three of these and within 1-2 months, ALL three of them ""broke"". The seams on two of the beds broke, leaving a huge bulge in the middle of the bed and the seams of the third bed kept coming apart..Im not sure how many holes I had to cover but way more than their repair kit allowed for. After contacting the company and starting the refund process, I was told that since they were bought through Amazon I wouldn't be able to receive a refund. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Yes, the beds are $35.00 so I definitely got what I paid for but can't believe how cheaply they are made. DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS!!!! Spend more to get more bang for your buck!",__label__1
"nice sleep, but bottom seam blew: Just a great item. However there are approximately 5 length-wise seams on the bottom to create stability. After two months, one seam ""disappeared, and now the bed rocks, because there is one large air space.I can probably live with it, just have to put some towels, whatever to stabilize it.",__label__1
"slow leaking: Air mattress: Looks good, works but requires frequent running of pump. Appears to lose air through the built-in pump. Should have returned the mattress but need the bed for visitor. Probable would not buy with built-in pump in future.",__label__1
"doesn't leak but uncomfortable to sleep on: I bought this product because I'm living temporarily in a city and will move to another city later, and don't have the extra money to buy a better bed. Since then my shoulders hurt from sleeping on it. I've lost interested in sleeping after that. Before that i never have problems with sleeping.It's ok to sleep for one or two nights only i guess. If you intend to sleep on it for a few months, buy a comfy bed instead of this!",__label__1
"Very satisfied!!!!!!!!: I have not seen or slept on this mattress........bought for my daughter for a quick replacment.............she tell's me she thinks it GREAT.....I bought the twin size,and she tells me when she buys a full size it will be the same one. I have an inflatable bed she has slept on while visiting, and she said this is 100% better. I might add my daughter is not someone who is easily pleased.",__label__2
"Comfortable, but needs insulation from cold: We purchased 2 of these for guests' use and they are quite comfortable. The pumps work relatively quickly and quietly, and allow for good firmness in the mattress. They also held air well and needed little additions over 2 weeks' time.Our only drawback was that the air doesn't provide insulation from cooler ambient air. We keep our home cooler at night, and a guest found it necessary to cover the mattress with a heavy blanket to insulate properly from the coolness. I would recommend a mattress pad or foam topper when using this to provide some extra warmth.",__label__2
Not Durable: Had the bed two weeks and so far not a problem. I did not inflate it to the maximum pressure-I'm 250lbs the maximum load being 300lbs-but rather 3/4 full of air. I have added air only one time-maybe 10 seconds. I sleep on this airbed every night. There is a tendancy for me to roll to the side of the bed-whether that's just me or the bed is yet to be seen. To add to this review I had the bed for three months-the pump went out after that time. I suppose we take our chances.MalcolmL,__label__1
"This product is great.: This bed is great. I use it everyday for my little.So far its still inflated and very comfortable.Recommend it for anyone who has a guess or personal use.I especially like the pump, how its connected to the bed andcan store-it inside the bed.",__label__2
Cheap Not worth your money: I purchase this air mattress in late October and two month later I was laying on the mattress I move my arm and a fist size hole appear over my head. The mattress arrive fast and was easy to set up. If you plan on using this mattress for a guest bed or for your kids when they come home for the Holiday or summer break please get something else. Not worth the money. I had Coleman and small hole appear and the patch does not work but for this mattress the patch does work for a small hole not the fist size hole.,__label__1

Worst Air Bed Ever.: This mattress began leaking after only 3 or 4 nights of use. I found the leakbetween a crease in the top (flocked) side. After proper repair effort it wasunable to stay inflated. I have put the air bed to better use. Thank youKeith Colton,__label__1
"Nice rest: Really nice portable bed, I don't wanna back sleeping in a regular bed!!!. I highly recommend this item for everybody who is looking for a good bed to be sleeping like a baby.",__label__2
I would definatly buy this again: The bed was comfortable and filled easily. It's only draw back was that did not fit all the way back into the carring box.,__label__2
"Leaked: We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud. The airbed had a gash at the bottom, which we patched. But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work. We returned it, unslept-on -- no easy task, since we were required to return the manufacturer's box, and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it, so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer's box.",__label__1
"Worst purchase ever.: This was the worst product I ever bought. It held up only about 40 days and then, got more inflated on one side then the other. Of course ended in the trash. I have no car, so was very hard for me to return the item, and go to the post office. Waste of money. Do not order from this company ever. BAD PRODUCTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!",__label__1
Bad product: This is not worth the price. Used it once and had to re-inflate it five times. Does not hold air. A piece of junk.,__label__1
"Not satisfied: The air mattress was good only for one day, after one day it started deflating and I have to inflate it every night before sleep. By the time I wake up on it the next day it has become like a water bed since it has deflated. I cannot find the hole from where it deflates.",__label__1
"Good value, works as advertised: I bought this air bed to accommodate a 120 lb. guest who used it for five days. The initial fill took only a few minutes. It was really convenient. It needed only 5-10 seconds of re-inflation after 3 days to make up for lost air. Even so, we weren't sure if the bed had lost any air at all. This mattress has remained inflated for 3 weeks now without losing air as far as I can tell. I'm happy with my purchase -- it does its job.",__label__2
This bed will not retain air.: It was a super deal... But there is something wrong with it. It will not retain the air level that I want.I will be returning this item,__label__1
"Twin Airbed w/built-in electric pump: This product worked just as advertised. Inflated in less than 3 minutes, and after testing for 2 weeks, remains inflated with just minor refill of air required. Great value for the price. Highly recommended.",__label__2
"TERRIFIC Air Mattress!: I inflated this air bed for a guest who reported how comfortable it was. The twin fitted sheet worked great and didn't slip around with the flannel surface. The installed inflation/deflation pump also worked great and was fast. My guest used the air bed for an entire week, and it never lost air or got soft. My only criticism is that the static on the rubber underside did pick up some loose dirt and dog hair that was on the hardwood floor where I placed the bed.",__label__2
"Not available.: I don't really hate it, because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason. The order was cancelled several days after I placed it, so I'm no fan of Intex.",__label__1
"Worth the price!: I move between places a lot and hence can't afford to buy permanent bed frames and mattresses. I wanted to buy this portable bed and use it for everyday sleep and also as a standby couch. It's been serving the purpose well so far for the couple of weeks. I've gotta wait and see if any major leaks occur in the future.Here's the reason for the missing star. It never becomes flat or very saggy, but needs air top up daily for sure. Especially since I'm using this also as a couch to sit, sometimes I need to inflate it for a couple of minutes before going to sleep to get the firmness I want. Of course it is absolutely not as comfortable as a box spring mattress on a frame, but I can assure that this is definitely worth the bucks if the need is an inexpensive temp bed for everyday use.By the way, this very same model costs $89 in Walmart when I checked, hope now it is not!",__label__2
"Very Comfortable - Convenient Build in pump: Used while camping for a week and was delighted by the level of comfort and the ease of inflating with the built in pump! Air loss for me was in line with the many other airbeds I have owned, and with the built in pump, made it easy to top it off every other day or so. Highly recommend this great affordable air mattress!",__label__2
"Leaky unit: I ordered this bed in an emergency situation for my 95 year old mother to sleep on. The bed was easy to fill and evacuate, but it has a slow leak that necessitates adding air to it every day. I couldn't send it back because I would have had nothing for my mother to sleep on.",__label__1
customer service is dead: every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $103.10 for and was refunded $40.70 . thanks,__label__1
"Just like all the other airbeds: I filled it with air when it arrived. It lost air by the morning. Since the bed was cold when filled, I gave it another chance. The first night is was actually used, it had to be refilled in the middle of the night.",__label__1
Lasted one month of everyday use: I used this product for one month of every night sleeping before it sprouted a leak in one of the seams on top that couldn't be patched due to the fabric. It makes patches virtually impossible to stay stuck.There you have it.,__label__1

"Extra Bed: Love it! When the boys come home and bring their friends, everyone has a bed!!! They roll up small and tight for easy storage. Also, they are very comfortable. I will even inflate one so I can enjoy sleeping by the warm fire on very cold nights.",__label__2
Air Mattress works great: We loved the internal pump which also will pump the air out. It is so fast and the mattress itself gives a good night's sleep.,__label__1
"Intex Pillow Rest Twin AirBed: This bed was purchased as a spare bed for short time visitors as we are limited in space in our Park Model RV. We needed someting that didn't take up much room to store and yet was comfortable enough so that as person could get a decent nights sleep on it. After reading all the reviews I could find, I deduced that some of these beds were faulty (like all things) and that they tended to deflate overnight, but, that most were fine. Our bed has met all of our expectations and is fine, comfortable and holds the air. I would highly recommend this product!!",__label__2
"BEST AIR MATTRESS EVER!: This bed is awesome, perfect size, pump works great just a bit noisy like a vaccuum cleaner, ordered it on friday got monday the next week even though i used standard shipping (3-5 business days).",__label__2
"Great airbed!: Really great airbed, comfortable, easy to inflate, portable. Seems to deflate rather quickly but only takes 5 seconds to refill.",__label__2
Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: I received this air bed over two months ago and we love it. I bought it for my granddaughter to sleep on and it's the easiest thing to set up and take down to put away. I put a mattress pad on under the sheets and she says she would rather sleep on the air bed than her regular bed because it that comfortable. No leaks so far. I'm very happy with this purchase.,__label__2
"Intext Pillow Rest Twin Airbe: I was so excited when I received this air bed, but after sleeping on it on the first night, things changed. Every single night I had to put more air in it in order to keep it firm. There were no leaks that I could hear, but it was a pain to keep putting air in it every night. If this does not bother you, the bed itself is extrmeley comfortable.Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump",__label__1
"GREAT BED, GREAT PRICE: THIS AIR BED IS GREAT! I HAD PREVIOUSLY PAID WAY MORE FOR THE ""A--O"" BRAND, BUT THIS ONE IS EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE. I AM A GAL WITH A ""MATURE"" FIGURE, AND IT (TWIN) ONLY LOST A LITTLE AIR. WITH THE ELECTRIC PUMP, NO WORRIES! JUST A HINT FOR SOME OF YOU WITH BAD KNEES LIKE I HAVE....I PLACED TWO CAMP COTS SIDE BY SIDE AND LAID THE MATTRESS ON TOP. PERFECT FOR THESE TIRED OLD KNESS AND BODY TO GET UP AND OFF OF. KUDOS ON THIS AIR BED!",__label__2
LEAKED FIRST DAY FOR MY GUEST: IT HAD A LEAK FROM DAY ONE. RETURN AND EXCHANGE PROCESS WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH. STILL WAITING ON THE NEW ONE,__label__1
Super airbed: Ordered two and tested them out: one had a bad pump but the return was easy.These airbeds are super cheap and great. Everyone who has slept on them says they are extremely comfortable. They hold the air well. I recommend them very highly,__label__2
"Low Quality: Bought this product for a friend's visit back in late October. Since then (It is now early February), it has been slept on for a total of seven nights by two different normal sized adult guests, and promptly deflated when a third guest tried to sleep on it this past week. To its credit, the product did last just fine through those seven nights. It did, however, break not too long after the 90 day warranty ended and we have no reason to believe we will be able to repair it or otherwise recoup our loss. Purchase with the understanding that this is basically a disposable air bed with a warranty that seems conveniently short.",__label__1
blow up bed: I purchased for my guest room for overnight stays for family members.this holds up very well especially for grandchildren,__label__2
"not reccomended: Would not purchase this item again. Used in spare bedroom for guests. Hardly used, until now. Hoping top have Xmas guests use. First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared. They provide plastic to repair leaks, but do not provide any adhesive. I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit, not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months.",__label__1
Intex Pillow rest Twin: I ordered this for a friend who was displaced and has had to start over. He had a Airbed from a store but kept having to bring it back due to leaks and other problems. This bed looked much more comfy and with my Prime discount I sent it to him. Within the two day time frame it arrived and as soon as the other bed sprung another leak he put it to work. He says it's very comfy compared to the other so if he's happy I'm happy with the product,__label__2
"Good price, good night.: Decent product. I had to sleep on it for a few nights and I survived. It is comfortable enough to pass out on It stayed inflated the whole night and deflates well. It comes with a sack for storage, though my folding skills are pretty lame, so fitting it into the bag is a challenge for me.",__label__2
"Hold on a minute: Add these ingredients:Flashy music, beautiful ladies, sexy dance moves, scanty clothes (no nudity), beautiful landscapes, and even some seaside hobbies... and what do you get?Wait a minute...Now add a film editor who thinks his amateurish effects are more important than the above ingredients. All the above scenes of the hobbies, the ladies, the landscapes were all spliced and edited into each other for a ""strobe"" effect of split second images so that you can't focus on any of it.Now what do you have?Probably a yard sale item in the 10 for a dollar bin.

"Get Out Your Magnifying Glasses!: Although this is a good collection of Poe's short stories, the pages crisp and the typeface clear, THE TYPE ITSELF IS VERY, VERY, VERY SMALL! I am getting older, but do not need glasses yet and I can hardly read a word or two before my eyes begin to cross! I don't understand book manufacturers anymore. Either the typeface is illegible, the paper so poor that all the letters blot together, or the print is teenie tiny. Aren't books supposed to be read? Also, something strange, the chapters arent seperated. One story runs into the next without starting a new page.",__label__1
"Nesmith goes too far: Carrying on from the mostly instrumental albums of ""The Prison"" & ""The Garden"", we get ""Rays"".Which is nowhere as strong as these albums, with Nez laying on the Synths, giving a slight Queen from the 80's feel (which nobody wants to hear).He also creates a horn section using the synths, which just sounds cheap & tacky.With ""Prison"" & ""Garden"" you hear richly textured & ambitious soundscapes, but ""Rays"" is to low-fi (which I don't have a problem with), it just doesn't work with such a complete piece of work.This is the only weak Nesmith album, so I suggest you purchase the rest of his back catalogue before arriving at this (low) point.",__label__1
"Got ""Burnt"" By Rays: This entire album sounds like it was rather cheaply recorded via nothing but sequencing on keyboards that really don't sound that great anyway.It reminds me of those keyboards you used to buy where you could push one key and it would play a song for you.I really don't understand why he released this. I've been a Nez fan for years, but this one left me feeling quite ripped off.I feel he's taking his fans for gullible idiots with this half hearted attempt at an album; thinking we'll buy anything he puts out.",__label__1
good and unique music: I heard some long-time fans of Michael Nesmith were confused. You'll listen to Michael's new sound.,__label__2
Best Lan Case for full size mobo: Excellent case! It comes in handy once a month for lan partys due to the carrying harness. Not to mention the weight will not break your back compared to other cases.I have owned SFF (Small Form Factor) machines in the past but I have to admit nothing beats the cooling and hardware upgrade potential of the Antec Super Lanboy.,__label__2
"One of the very best.....: This is one of the very best ""rockumentaries"" ever! I loved the whole thing, especially the interviews....especially the ones with the ultra-talented producer/singer/song writer/pianist John Simon-my friend. You might consider checking out John's own recordings.",__label__2
"A great documentary of one of the best albums ever: Any fan of the Band's music would get a lot out of seeing this documentary, which reveaks the creative process that went into their two masterworks, ""Music From Big Pink"" and ""The Band"". Band"" the story of Music from Big Pink is also covered here. Great interviews and stories from producer/engineer Joe Simon, and band members Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko as well as a fitting obit to Richard Manuel.",__label__2
"Great documentary on a great album.: I've always like VH-1's Classic Albums series and this episode doesn't disappoint. Great interviews with Robbie, Levon, and other band members (Including Rick Danko, who died last December). I love how they broke down Rag Momma Rag and Rockin' Chair into it's separate parts. A must for all Band Fans.",__label__2
"THE BAND: THE BROWN ALBUM: When the ""Classic"" series of videos came out, I could only wish for anything on The Band. The ""Brown Album"" or their 2nd album is highlighted here in story and song. The interviews are well worth the price of admission. The Brown Album has always surfaced as one of the top 10 favorites of many other music artists. Watching Garth Hudson at the keyboard; or Levon Helm explain his drum technique; or sitting at the recording console and listening to the harmonies with producer John Simon, is a look inside of a group that changed the sound of North American music in the late 60's to mid 70's. This was probably their best effort of them all and to have it chronicled here is great. I have both the VHS & DVD versions. Since then I purchased Live at the New Orleans JazzFest.",__label__2
"Excellent Documentary of one of the Greatest Albums in History: This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end. It is that good. Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven. Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face. I'm not waxing poetic here, folks. If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD.",__label__2
A must for fans of The Band: This is a terrific video - especially if you are a fan of The Band.I never realized how great Richard Manual was until I saw this video.,__label__2
"The Band: Although the recording was somewhat ineresting, due to the lack of music in the recording I find very dissapointing. I will probably play it three or four times and then dispose of it.",__label__1
"Blah Blah Blah.......: Good God, was this boring! I couldn't even finish watching it before I tossed it. I usually enjoy reading or hearing how artists create, it fascinates me. And I love The Band that used to be. But this was boring as heck. Sorry, Robbie. Sorry, Levon.",__label__1
You're Kidding!: I just screened the dvd of The Band which cost $65.00! If you like 75 minutes of interviews with some musical clips (all far better in The Last Waltz--where each song is 100% seen on camera and mixed great) than send me $55.00 and I'll ship you my copy. I love The Band but this looks like a BBC TV doc.Bill,__label__1

"BROKE after a short time, not truly waterproof, way too large, and smells like rubber: This item broke after a very short time of use. It is not truly waterproof as it stopped working after its first try in the bathtub/shower. The next day it was dead, and water kept leaking from it. So now it's dead.It is very big, way too big to be really comfortable and it is hard to insert. It is not flexible or pliable, so it is not adjustable to people's bodies or preferences! The bullet function actually burns, so it is not pleasant. Also when it is first opened a very very very strong rubber smell comes out, and it definitely does not go away.It's not high quality, it broke very fast.",__label__1
"Terrible: After repeated washings, it still smelled like a toxic plastic and who wants to put toxic plastic inside their body. Also, it didn't do the job. So I wasted my money and had to throw it away.",__label__1
"Great power, not great shape: The reviews were right about it being VERY large in girth. It was a bit uncomfortable, and I didn't love the bumps on the back (that you can't see in the picture or in the description), and the ""head"" of it has quite an edge.When you take it out of the package, it has an overwhelming smell of plastic, so it probably contains those carcinogens that everyone is talking about.The exterior piece is VERY powerful and would be great if it was on another toy. The tickler is also fairly rigid and difficult to place exactly.I wouldn't recommend it because I think you can do better. And I also think it's worth it to spend more money on a toy without phthaylenes (or however you spell it).",__label__1
"way too big: This product is NOT intended for a beginner...i had many toys and this one by far caught me by suprise on how big it is. The shaft is too big and makes it uncomfortable unless used with the right lubrication. Being a smaller/petite woman, it was a little uncomfortable for me b/c of the size...but other than that, it was very pleasurable.",__label__1
ridiculous: I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product ........turns out it's about the same diameter as the cardboard tube inside paper-towels. Seriously ???~~~,__label__1
"Help!: Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!",__label__1
"Not waterproof!: It's not water proof and it rusts on the inside. The turning head is a nice feature, but I don't think I really needed it.",__label__1
"Easy Climax: I'm very pleased with this product because it has a natural feeling head and makes climaxing easyand can be used in the bathtub,shower or where ever.",__label__2
PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE: WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST TIME BUYING SUCH AND IT NEVER WORKED. MOTOR NEVER TURNED WHEN BATTERY WAS PUT IN. SUCH BLATANT ROBBERY!,__label__1
"Doesnt work: First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought, to help with the lonely nights, was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works. She asked me to order her another so I looked around and found this one, it had many decent reviews so I decided to order it. When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference, the one she had before was about 5 inches or so. She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy. When she attempted to use the item it did not work, she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on. It would be extremely helpful if there were some sizes and lengths to determine what exactly you were buying. So all in all I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.",__label__1
"Yuck: This thing smells SO gross, like harsh, toxic chemicals, that I can't even use it! I've washed it in HOT, super soapy water, cleaned it with alcohol, and even let it ""air out,"" all to no avail. I tried using it and the smell was seriously distracting. I took it out of my drawer, after all the washing, to show it to my boyfriend and while i was still a good four feet away he said, ""Ewww, what's that smell."" I found it to be WAY too large, too, and I've had kids. Sadly, this will be going in the garbage.",__label__1
"A Little Too Much: I thought this would be good to try because I love the floating beads in the other rabbit vibes. I am a single gal, solo practitioner so to speak, and found that the steel rotating balls are just not comfortable for me. They are too hard with no give and get quickly uncomfortable especially if you squeeze your muscles. I can usually have one orgasm with this toy but not the multiple orgasms with the more comfortable rabbit vibes with the pearl beads. It's okay but it just doesn't get the job done for me.",__label__1
well: i bought this for my wife to replace her rabbit habbit that broke after a few uses. let me first say that it say 1 1/2 inches no it makes the rabit habit look tiny. its hugeat least 1 3/4 inch around. but its much slower than the other dosent vibrate near as fast. other than the size being more real size she liked the rabit habit better but we just got this one maybe it will get better. just goes to show bigger isnt better always. needs more power,__label__1
"Painful, no pleasure, and doesn't work. Smells horrible!: First of all, no matter how much I washed it, it still smelled HORRIBLE! The ""rabbit ears"" are too long. The part it is supposed to hit isn't that high up. The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the ""floating beads"" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk. I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one, and I was mistaken. I don't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent, though.",__label__1
Beware-Can't return if defective as this one is!!!!!!!: This product would not even turn on once batteries were installed! It also has a terrible chemical odor which would probably cause most health conscious people not to risk actually using it anyway!Please be aware you cannot return so order at your own risk!,__label__1
"Defective/No Return: When I ordered this item, I was not aware that it could not be returned if defective. The item arrived very timely, but it would not operate. I later found out that the product is nonreturnable. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase.",__label__1
"Doesn't work: I received this item and it;s dead!Doesn't work and I cannot return it. wasted $40 bucks..I'm so angry, I bought this as a gag gift for my friend for a party and now i'm out money...Very disappointing...",__label__1
doesnt work: Put new batteries in - product wont turn on at all - very disappointed !!! Save your money - many others are better - should have read the other reviews and then i would have been warned,__label__1
"So Disappointing!: I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it, but when I got it I was so disappointed because it didn't work. It didn't even turn on! I didn't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item. I won't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again.",__label__1
"No go: I did not like this one. It is a bit large and it has a plastic, rubbery smell that never goes away. It's also slightly loud. I have had similar toys before and I like this one the least.",__label__1
Excellent: First rabbit and it works amazingly. It does things that I never expected it to do. I would definitely by another one if something ever happened to this one.,__label__2
didn't even work: Out of the box it didn't even work. Whats worse there isn't an easy way to return it. I'm having to email amazon and hope for an exchange within a week.?,__label__1
Okay.....: I think the rabbit part is kind of bothersome and I thought the actual shaft would vibrate not just the rabbit. WEIRD.,__label__2
"BREATH TAKING!!!: My boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas, i have to say at first (without using it) i was a little disappointed with the rotation i thought it would be stronger after using it though i thought this thing was absolutely amazing. my boyfriend seems to be a little jealous off it but i guess you'll have that lol. Ive used it in the shower now twice and i have had no problems at all. like other people have stated it does have a new rubber smell to it but its very faint to begin with and will fade off you really cant smell it unless its right up by your face. as far as width though... wet or lubricated Ive had a hard time getting it in. there's been times where i just gave up and didn't even bother because it hurt but once its in its actually very pleasurable. deff. not a toy for people who are inexperienced that's for sure. all in all great product and especially for the price I'm very pleased. : )!!! ill probably buy more here very soon lol",__label__2
"To Infinity and beyond!!!: This is a good lil machine for the price :) I got it for me (especially), but my boyfriend loves to use it on me too. Those little bunny ears work Freakin wonders!!!I never climaxed so quickly.I don't really care for the rotating beads as much as the vibrating bunny ears.When you combine them..boy watch out ;) I would buy this again if I had to.This is my favorite toy so far.",__label__2
I didn't think it was that good.: Got this product and used it but it doesn't get me to the big O. It's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears don't reach the right place. All i have to say it's just wasn't for me. I wish i didn't buy it.,__label__1
broke one first use: First time buying a toy of this type. Great orgazm but then the buttons stopped working and the devise would not increase in speed or intensity and nor wood it shut off. No wat to return it on Amazon due to policy,__label__1
DISAPOINTED: I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT. I PUT BATTERIES IN IT AND IT WORKED FOR THREE MINS AND QUIT. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AGAIN AND ACCORDING TO AMAZON POLICY I CAN'T RETURN IT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,__label__1
"Too Noisy: Other reviews state this item is very quiet. Mine makes a very loud grinding noise. If the windows were open, I think the neighbors would hear it. The noise is totally distracting, thus I cannot use this product. If it was quiet as stated by others, I think I might be very satisfied with it. Did I get a ""lemon?""",__label__1
"Very Cheap: I ordered this after my other rabbit quit working. Thought this one was affordable. Very Very cheaply made and not much power. Smells very bad, so much you could hardly stand to be in the same room as it, let alone use it. If you are going to buy a rabbit do not buy this one. Invest in one a little nicer.",__label__1
Totally Dissapointed! Like a bad Lover!: I just got this today and have been playing with it for a couple of hours and haven't gotten a decent orgasm. This is my first vibrator/toy ever and I don't think I will be buying any more. Maybe its just me but vibrations do little to nothing for me and the fact that this toys rabbit ears are way too long doesn't help. After playing with it for awhile and just being left frustrated I managed to get a weak orgasm not worth anywhere near the 30 dollars i paid for this! The vibe itself is way too thick and it has a awful chemical smell. I should saved my money! I will continue to try and play around with it but I am not hopeful. The rotating shaft also does NOTHING for me..,__label__1
"Loved it - till we got it wet!: It is NOT NOT NOT WATERPROOF! Loved it, till we tried it in the tub. Worked for 4 seconds, then stopped. VERY DISAPPOINTED....",__label__1
"Smells TOXIC and awful: This smells like paint thinner or something. It does NOT go away with washing or airing or anything else, and is so strong my entire ROOM smells like a chemical factory. Aside from the fact that it is a total buzz-kill to have this awful stink, I have no idea if it is save. Who knows what's in/on this thing and I certainly wouldn't want to put it in my body...it could be leaching chemicals. Cancer comes to mind. I had to throw it away. Total waste. Don't buy it, find another supplier!",__label__1
"Can't use it, can't return it.: I was really looking forward to using this item. However, upon opening it I was overcome with a strong chemical odor. The packaging says ""for novelty only"" which means, it's not safe. I did some research and found out this could actually cause cancer. Of course, I can't even return the stupid thing eventhough I never used it. Shame on you people for selling shoddy products that can esentially kill people.",__label__1
"Large and Hard!: Purchased online, good description with size included. However, when it arrived it was larger than advertised (length and circumference). It was actually to large and caused some discomfort. It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion. It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators!! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded, this is for you! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again.",__label__1
"Great Quality Toy: This is great, wife loves it. We've actually had 3 of them. Wore out the first 2 over the course of about a year each. This has never failed to please her.The only issue we have noticed with them, is the rubber seems to react with other rubber types and ""melt"". We have had it happen with all 3 of them. So if you keep your toys together (touching) like we do, you may want to keep this one in it's packaging so it doesn't get an impression of another toy melted into it.It does tend to get louder the more you use it or the older it gets. At first it was very quite, but now we have to keep a hold on the rabbit to stop the noise from being overly loud (Especially if the kids are home).Again, all the cons happen over time. We will probably keep on of these as long as we can continue to buy them. It's just really good at what it does even if it doesn't last forever.",__label__2
"Too Weak/Gentle: Received as a gift from my wishlist, I added it because of all the positive reviews and because it was waterproof (also the clear design looked cool), but quite honestly this is weaker than my cheapy $8 vibrator from a local shop. I have not tried it in water so I can't comment on that. It is also too stiff (rather than being too big), but mostly my issue is the very weak vibration, especially lacking in the area that should be stimulated most. The rotation also did nothing for me. With a name like Jackrabbit, I was expecting a lot more oomph. Don't bother with this product if your preference is not gentle... I found it annoying.",__label__1
hubby vs wife: shipped fast good price good explanation of the detail and all other great aspects of this item...would tell friends about,__label__2
Not for me: It is too thick for me and the material is very hard too uncomfortable I would not recommend it because it did not explained how the product really was and even though is brand new in the box never been used you can not return the product . So I just wasted my money...,__label__1
"one hit wonder: I tried this product. It broke during my first use. Then I contacted the seller and they told me to give good feedback and said they'd send a new one. It's been a month and I haven't received anything. I'm over this company, Joy Hollywood. Clearly they do not know how to treat customers or sell working products. the product not only broke but it, like other consumers said, smelled like something awful. I would feel safer going to an actual store where they actually test the products to make sure they work. or where they will gladly return something that was a LEMON.",__label__1
WOW!!: This product definitely does what is said to do. I haven't had any problems with it and its not too thick and the power is great.,__label__2
"Horrible!: I have tried rabbit toys in the past and they have all been great, so I was very excited to try this product. I got it in the mail, put batteries in it, and... it wouldn't turn on. I wish I had read the reviews on this more carefully before buying this, as I see now that a lot of other people have had this issue. I really hope I can return it. Don't waste your money- if you want a rabbit, you might as well buy a real good quality one so you don't waste your money like I did.",__label__1
"A quiet ride.: I was pretty surprised at how girthy it was when I opened the package. It is made with quality materials. There was the usual strong odor that tends to come along with new toys. But once soaped up nicely it seems much better. I feel lube is nessecary as a companion with this toy. Which can be a downfall at times. But the fact that it operates very smooth And quiet makes up for this. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and this brand. I love the fact that the batteries are kept in a tray that makes it super easy to keep them together and ready to go in between uses. Great price, good investment, great pleasure :)",__label__2
"Great Transaction!!!: Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,",__label__1
Not a good vibrator: I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed. Metallic beads are a almost painful on higher rotation speed. And the the metallic rod connecting the top with the bottom broke after 6 months.Do not recommend this item.,__label__1
NOT WATERPROOF BROKE IN ONE USE: This is TERRIBLE. I have had this for 3 hours and it is already broken. It is absolutely NOT waterproof. Do NOT waste your money.,__label__1
Disappointed: I was really excited to receive this product after reading the reviews. A day later I'm quite disappointed. The bunny ears are razor sharp! Oucccchhhhhh!!!Definitely save your money and go for something else,__label__1
"Awful: I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads. I was really disappointed in this product however. It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic.",__label__1
California Exotics jack rabbit: Piece of crap. All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use... horrible product. California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk. do not waste your money or shipping..,__label__1

"sooo biggggg: I had mixed reviews of this product. It most definitely got the job done, and fast! The only qualms that I had was that it was really large and hard to get in sometimes. Also I found that the rabbit ears would get in the way and could become annoying at times, but other than that it is a GREAT product.",__label__2
"Great after positioned right!: I got this today. As I was putting the 3 AA batteries in I had to try it out. I have a high sitting clit and the clit vib part had to be positioned right. Once I got it positioned right I was in heaven. I had the big ""O"" in a minute (probably under) and it was so intense I was shaking. The buttons were easy to manage once you got the position right. I don't think I will try this in the water since other reviewers have and the toy wouldn't work after. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great toy. My husband is looking forward to using this on me tonight since telling him how amazing it is.",__label__2
Seems to be good!: This seems to be good so far only used it once. I really thought that the shaft vibrated but it does not. Love the bullet in the rabbit ears... so far so good!,__label__2
Nothing: Nothing to to say about it thank u didn't enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money,__label__1
"Disappointing: Once again I wish I'd paid closer attention to the more critical reviews ... This product is far too rigid and thick. With the beads and other material in the center, it does not bend at all, and it's painful to try to use. There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip (which is 1.5 inches wide, 5 inches around) that make it even more painful to insert. I've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product (beads and rabbit, but none of those bumps, and a more natural tip and girth) and hoped it was the same thing, but it isn't. On the upside, it's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it'll be even more quiet, unused, in my nightstand. Waste of money.",__label__1
"disappointed: I never actually got to use this product, when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response.",__label__1
"wow: Little different then I was expecting but really good quality and exactly as advertised, fast deliver an great service, thanks",__label__2
Ouch!: The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards. If the ears weren't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites.,__label__1
Jack Rabbit: The rotating beads jammed after 2 uses and no longer work. Also the item is non returnable so I can't even return it and get a new one. ):,__label__1
"Outstanding in and out of water: My wife was skeptical about purchasing a new toy. Until now, she had not cared for any toy we have used. We ended up buying the Jack Rabbit because so many of our friends recommended it. We chose to try it first in the jacuzzi...it only took about 90 seconds. The next morning, we tried it in bed with the same results. My wife is now a huge fan of the bunny ears! I highly recommend this item. But it now!!!",__label__2
"The worst ever: This is one of the worst one i ever bought. The price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use. There is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head. Since this product can not be return, I used it once and went righ in the trash.",__label__1
"Awesome once you find your rhythym!: I bought this because I was tired of wearing myself out in other ways (haha). I am pretty much a nontoy user, but when I saw what all this thing could do and for the price, I was hooked! It came on time in very discreet packaging (Thank you Lord!). A regular Amazon Box and a black bag on the inside, completely sealed. I don't live alone and was worried someone else would open it.I wasn't expecting it to be so HUGE. I took it slow, and was able to use it after a little coaxing. A little painful, but eventually I found my rhythym and it was AMAZING. Controls are easy to reach and the spinning feature is heavenly!So, it takes getting used to if you are inexperienced, but it's definitely worth it!",__label__2
"Reviews are so off--terrible!: I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money.",__label__1
"Works like a charm: For me, this is pretty much a sure thing. Sometimes I use the rotating beads. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on my mood. The rabbit vibration is stronger when the beads are turned off. The size of the item is pretty long/thick and I do prefer this size to some of the other items I have. My current favorite item. Haven't tested to see if it's waterproof ... too worried that it'll stop working and then I'll be SOL.",__label__2
"False Advertising: The picture shows several items when you select the purple one and has ""alternate views"" showing these items. And the kicker is that its 10$ more than the other colors, so it seems like its a package deal, but I only got the one purple vibe. I totally would have gotten the clear one for less money if I knew that was the case because who cares what color it is really. I, for one, am about function over fashion. FALSE ADVERTISING!!",__label__1
"Not waterproof!: This thing is awful! The first time I used it water it filled up with water and shorted out. I've dried it, replaced the batteries and it still won't work. I only used it 2 times. This is a total waste of money!",__label__1
"Holy Crap!!!: This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it. It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old, but this thing blows it out of the water literally. Its fun by myself and with my husband. I just really have nothing bad to say, other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec. But I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.",__label__2
"Yet another disappointed customer: Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done.",__label__1
"jams: LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use.",__label__1
"Ehh.: It's way too big for me. I bought it several months ago, and have used it maybe 3 times. It's uncomfortable. Also, the picture is MISLEADING! Inspecting it closer now, I see the little nubby on the pink jack rabbit, but it says nothing about there being several rows of hard, plastic nubbies near the head of the toy. Sad I wasted my money on this product.",__label__1
Pretty large: Not made for the delicate sized person or in smaller areas of exploration. All features are as described and rabbit is fast on slowest setting. Smaller would be better.,__label__1
"Poor quality: I gave this product as a ""special"" gift to my wife for Christmas, She just loved it for the first 2 times of use, except we had to make sure the kids were asleep because it is loud. Now it just spins away, but no vibrations. She will still use it on occasions, it can still get the job done, but for the money I payed it didn't last near long enough.",__label__1
SUPERB: This toy took a little getting use to. But after a few times playing with it I was amazing. I wish there were more options for the speed & vibration but It makes me quite happy & I'm not always easy to please. ;-),__label__2
Wife loves this little guy: This is our 2nd one of these. The first one lasted about 2 yrs and my wife was very sad about its passing. But the 2nd is just as satisfying for her as the 1st. Wonderful item : ),__label__2
"Not pelased: I was not pleased with this product, the bunny ears does not reach my ""pretty bump"".....I haven't used it ever since...I bought another for $25 and it got to the work done way better than this...",__label__1
Broken Item: Recieved this item and it was broken. Tried to contact the seller but could not. As per amazon's return policy this is a non-returnable item. Which makes sense. Unless it is sold in a non-working condition. Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help. Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress. Will not buy non-returnable items from this site again. Leaves too much room to get a defective product like I did and be stuck with it.,__label__1
"Looking For Similar to Better Shower Companion: Best Part? Nice Girth (unusual for a rabbit). Worst? Length. I find it too short. And the ""off"" button has stopped working (maybe it wants to keep going and going and going? *L*) I have to untwist the bottom pannel and loosen the batteries to turn it off.Overall it's OK. It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower, but I'd like to find something similar (but a little longer) for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff, it should be made of something just a little softer.",__label__1
"Broken: I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work. Complete waste of money.",__label__1
"Breaks easily!: I have only had this product for three months, and after a month I was having problems with this product. I have given up on this vibe, and I do not recommend buying this product. Spend the extra money on something that will actually last!",__label__1
"Looked good, didn't work: This was my first purchase of a vibrator and was very disappointed. It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly, but it didn't work. I put in fresh batteries and it wouldn't turn on. I even tested the batteries, they were good, but this rabbit wasn't. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns on this type of personal product. I simple won't buy anything made by California Exotics again. I'll try one of the other brands next time.",__label__1
"Works really well right up until it doesn't: It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator.",__label__1
"Very disappointed: I don't know why this has such good reviews. I purchased it because of the reviews but it's since gone in the trash. It has an awful smell that won't go away. Like a burned plastic smell. It is WAY too big. The rotating beads do nothing for me. Even if you put your hand on the shaft, you have to squeeze to feel the rotation. Don't buy it.",__label__1
NO WAY!: This product worked for 4-5 times and the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.,__label__1
"Awesome Product: I bought this for my fiancé for during foreplay it was the best thing I bought her! She loves it it makes her go wild she has gets so horny while I use it on her and it makes sex a million times better! She goes crazy while I pleasure her with this vibrator! Than durig sex she is amazing! It was definatly a great added touch to our sex life! If any guys Re lookin to please there women to the max and than have crazy sex afterwords, buy this product cause you will have an expierance of a life time! Awesome product and work amazing! And this is the best price I found on the Internet! Everywhere else I looked was a lot more than amazon! Good luck",__label__2
"BORING!: I have enjoyed all the Fleetwood Mac albums and thought this video would provide excellent sound tracks from their album Rumors. Unfortunately, both me and my guests were extremely disappointed by boring commentary mixed in with partial sound tracks..... A book would have been more entertaining.",__label__1
"YOU DON'T GET TO SEE OR HEAR THE SONGS: This DVD contains discussions of the songs on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours Album, but not the songs themselves. They tell you about the song, how it was produced, what was going on and then they don't play it. If you are lucky they show about a 10 second video clip. It would not have cost the powers-to-be a dime to show a video of each song after it was discussed. In my opinion this ""Album"" is a tribute to arrogance. I will be sending it back.",__label__1
"Misleading.: Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans.",__label__1
"Zero Stars: Rumours is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I was dying to see this video. The one on the making of Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was a real treat, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it is just them saying over and over again that it was difficult being trapped in a small studio together, while they were breaking up. The only thing I did not already know, that I got from this video, is that Mick Fleetwood seems like a pretty nice guy, but the other three are self-absorbed jerks. Listen to the album again and again, but I recommend not wasting your time on this pointless and thoroughly uninteresting video.",__label__1
"A ""Box of Chocolates"": I'm really upset with myself for not more closely reading the reviews that said there wasn't music, just talking about the songs. I like the Fleetwood Mac, but not personally. I thought I was buying a concert performance with commentary. If you don't get a preview, you don't know what you'll get.",__label__1
"A WASTE OF VIEWING TIME AND MONEY!: THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM 'RUMORS' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES? I WANTED TO SEE F-M PERFORM AND WAS VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DIDN'T. AT LEAST I HAVE MEMORIES OF TWO OF THEIR CONCERTS THAT I ATTENDED YEARS AGO.",__label__1
"Very satisfying and informative.: An honest and articulate accounting of the year that produced one of the finest pop albums ever made.As a musician, I was thrilled by the segments that take place in the studio with the original master tapes, breaking down the arrangements, revealing the extraordinary harmony singing, and exposing unused material.As a fan, I was moved by the almost incredible story of two couples breaking up but choosing to continue their work together. It seems that there could have been no ""Rumours"" without the angst that fueled the songs.Bravo to the producers of the ""Classic Albums"" series.",__label__2
"Don't be fooled this is just a documental: No one song complete, just short clips and explanations about the making of the album, nice but not for a dvd, at least in my humble opinion.",__label__1
"Buy something else: The dvd is a documentory, alot of talking and very little music. I thought it was them in concert. Too much talking",__label__1
"eBay, here I come!: Well, I am among those who expected the basic performances along with the documentary, based on the packaging and the song titles listed in the text.I'm glad so many people like it because that means I will have no trouble selling my copy.The sound quality didn't impress me, and the ""specially recorded"" versions of some songs told me only that the members have lost their voices. (offstage: ""Sacrilege! Burn him!"")Even the navigation was annoying - click,click, click, click to get to any one song.Bah!",__label__1
"Fleetwood Mac Rumours: If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video.",__label__1
"Confused: I was very much disappointed with this album.I really didn't need to hear of all their problems in life.I did not purchase this album to hear them talk about themselves, I wanted to hear their music, which on this album there is very little. I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music.",__label__1
"Rumours DVD: The Rumours DVD is a retrospective documentary made 21 years after its release. Nothing more and nothing less. It's appeal will primarily benefit those interested in the way the tracks were laid down, the underlying emotions that led to the creation of the individual songs, and hearing bits and pieces of the tracks with the other instruments removed. It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying. Those looking for film footage of the songs being played in their entirety will be disappointed.",__label__2
"disapointed after watching ""The Dance"": Having seen ""The Dance"" before, I was totally disappointed. I was expecting at least the full songs from the CD, but it has only interviews with the band and commentaries. Also the picture quality on my dvd (I bought Region 2) was just bad quality. Not worth buying.",__label__1
"It's just a nice to OK documentary: It's disappointing to say the least. I'm not sure what Suzzette Phillips is talking about in her review, but on my version the classic album rumors isn't on my dvd. (And nowhere on the disc or packaging does it say the album is contained on the disc. Possibly, there are two versions? Anyway, 75 minutes of interviews about each song, and vintage footage each lasting about 15 to 30 seconds. Nothing new is on here that you haven't seen on any other documentary. It would be great if they played the vintage live selections in their entirety.",__label__1
"entertaining but could have been better: If the archival video footage of the songs had been shown in their entirety, I would rate this DVD a 10+. That stuff is out there, these clips are teasers. In fact, I own some old FM concert VHS tapes which I purchased when new (Tusk documentary, Mirage tour, etc). I look at the vaults on The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac cd and wonder why not DVD? Frustrating, they would look and sound great. Still, I never saw the Rumours photo session footage which is included on this DVD and that was an unexpected treat even if it was too short. I knew at the time of Rumours release that there was a lot of turmoil going on in the band but had no idea to what extent until I watched these interviews. All's well now apparently since they have a new cd due out in April. I sure will miss Christine, though. I recommend this DVD to any old diehard Fleetwood Mac fans who crave anything from those good old days and also to the new ones so that you can learn about their history.",__label__2
"Absolutely wonderful!: I loved this video! Having bought multiple copies of the album, cassette, and finally CD (which doesn't wear out!), it should be obvious that I'm ecstatic about the music. Now, I've added this wonderful inside look to my collection. If you're a Fleetwood Mac ""Rumours"" fan, this is the best gift you could receive from someone! Every Fleetwood Mac fan will love this on their shelf to replay at will. Phenomenal!",__label__2
"too frustrating for the price: Just bought this at the garden center. Looked solid. However, instructions are completely inadequate. I've programmed these kind of things before. I know it's hard to be able to create all the functions needed with just three buttons, but that's why you need to research what the competition is doing.",__label__1
"So easy: I had no problem setting times and days for the unit to run it is so easy, I have also purchased 2 of the double outlet timers of the same make so that did make easy for me to set the single timer. Fitting to the tap is easy and the unit does exactly what I wanted it for. I would recommend this make of timer to anybody for ease of setting and for how it runs.",__label__2
"It's all good!: This timer is AWESOME! It's very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won't hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs",__label__2
"Solid water timer: I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer.Returned that because it was terrible.Couldn't even keep time!Cheap cheap cheap.Ordered a couple of these and so far impressed.Quality feel and function, made in Germany.I had no problems programming this, very logical.Worked perfectly so far.No comparison to the Ray Padula Time It Deluxe Water Timer.The Claber is like a Mercedes, the Padula, a Kia.But, that is really unfair to Kia.Spend the extra few dollars and return it if I'm wrong.",__label__2
"Not recommended: Pro: Soft-closing valve mechanism prevents water hammer effect.Cons: Programming is not intuitive. Cannot adjust the manual valve-open time duration; it is fixed at 15 minutes (the manual states it is possible to adjust this, but I did not see how). 9V battery didn't last a week.",__label__1
"1. Something Good: I wanted to buy this song but couldn't figure out how to do it from the webpage. I don't have any problem buying Apple products, or ATT products or anyone else's products. But I could not figure out how to buy a song from Amazon.",__label__1
"uhhh yuk!: I love techno and have listened to it since it's onset in 1989 or 1990. This CD, however, has not aged well. In 1992 when this was released I tolerated it because there weren't many techno artists or CDs out there. Now I see that this CD is simply tiresome, crass garbage. Samples of Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are overused and abused and the only reason this drivel was played on the radio or in any club. I think this CD has been stuck under the backseat of my Volvo 244 since 1993. And it probably has gunk on it.",__label__1
"If I was stranded on a desert island with one album...: If I was stranded on a desert island with one album it would be this one. One deep complex song after another. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and take a trip into a world where the beat never ends and melodies play with your emotions.",__label__2
Where the Cypress Rises: This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family's move to Umbria. Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes. Ryan articulates connections between the natural and built environments and the adventure of the self; between ancient traditions and contemporary creativity. I found it highly engaging - a page-turner. I'll return to it.,__label__2
"Like the sprial binding, not much else: The spiral binding on this book is it's only positive.I haven't found a single thing in this book I would like to stitch. The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on.",__label__1
"Garbage.: Product came with no documentation whatsoever, no installation CD. Attempted to install this on 2 computers. ""plug and play"" install did not work. downloaded the appropriate drivers from Soundblaster and informed me that NO soundblaster card was found on my PC. attempted to contact vendor,no email was available, only a long distance phone number. Threw it in the trash.",__label__1
"Just Plain Good Music: Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers. If you'd just like to hear a fantastic voice sing fantastic songs, buy this. You definitely won't be disappointed.",__label__2
"Paper on ""hand decorated"" box looks cheap: I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It may be ""exotic"" wood but the paper stuck to the wood is coming off the front left corner and greatly diminishes its beauty. The tea is nice but it's not worth the money, in my opinion. I knew the box wouldn't be hand painted but I thought the craftsman would've done a better job of gluing down the paper.",__label__1
"Reflections from Largely Ignored Golfing Foundation: Little publicity gained from club pro, other than the infamous club pro's students who do good. These pros (male and female now) are true backbone of the sport, feeding the sport. In this case, Claude Harmon Jr. reflects on his father, famous club pro and player who wore the coveted Green Jacket.One clearly learns of life lessons Butch carried to his life and students from his father. Salient to his father's remarkable and here documented career is association with Henry Ford and Ben Hogan.There are many gleanings to take from this for golf, for life. Worth read which is personal and honest and passionate, reflecting the author.",__label__2
"My First Negative Review -- Ever: Others may like this book but I did not.For me, ""The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr."" was a huge disappointment and may be the worst book I have ever read.I kept trying to like this book, but the writing and the message kept getting in the way. Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he ""got his life together."" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read.",__label__1
"One of the best: I enjoyed this book tremendously! Butch Harmon tells it like it is, without pulling any punches! This is a story that needed to be told; it really gives us insight into the world of professional golf.",__label__2
"Good Book: I love the book by George C. Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese.",__label__2

"George Elliot's Romola: In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending.",__label__2
"everything you expect from George Eliot: Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-written. I'm even inspired to find out more about a historical period that's not really one of my favorites.",__label__2
"Ripped Off: Not worth the money at all. None of the music is mixed togeather, like by a DJ. Most of the songs are not by the original artists! I wish I had never purchased this order, and will never again purchase such an items without being able to hear all of the songs. One last thought,,I was an 80's nightcluber,,, some of the songs I never, ever heard of and they are not good what so ever, just fill in songs.",__label__1

"Patti Page attempts to sing jazz...: Unfortionately Miss Patti Page doesn't have the talent or chops to pull off a jazz session. Backed here by June Christy's regular orchestra, only shows how bad a singer Page is in comparison to the gifted Miss Christy. Miss Page doesn't have the syncopation, rhythm, or phrasing to attempt a project like this. Doris Day, Roseamry Clooney, and Tony Bennett are pop singers who can easily make the cross-over from pop to jazz, but talentless hacks like Patti Page, Teresa Brewer, and Johnny Mathis only make fools of them selves when trying. Stay awa yfrom this and just go out and buy any CD by Anita O'Day or June Christy, but for Heaven Sake's don't buy this.",__label__1
"Talentless hack takes a whack at jazz singing...: Patti Page ""The Tennessee Waltz Gal"" should never have attemted to record a jazz vocal album, for one she lacks the individuality that it takes to be a jazz singer, number two how can anyone take seriously a singer who sings ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window."" And three when she sings, she sounds like she doesn't care about what she's singing about, Page is definately not a lyrical singer.

"Grainy image: I can't resist writing a review, because I rely heavily on what others have to say too.I just bought the 1115 and it's being returned today. I've had an Epson Photostylus 870 for the past couple of years and had a little ink mis-hap (my fault) and thought, what the heck I'll get a new printer figuring the technology has improved, etc. This time I decided to go with an HP because I generally like their products, but I'm going back to an Epson.The quality of photo prints are not even comparable. The Epson prints are clear, crisp and realistic. The HP prints (even at 2400dpi) are grainy and fuzzy.Not to mention that ever since I installed the printer (using USB) my floppy disk drive has been grinding every few minutes. Not sure what's up with that.I will say that the HP is fast and fairly quiet. Printing regular documents on paper of course looks nice, but for ""real"" photo images try Epson.Good luck!",__label__1
"Uses yellow ink: I would not buy this printer again. It quickly uses up all the yellow ink. This is a common problem with this printer. See Yahoo Answers, search for ""hp photosmart yellow"". I think they should be recalled.",__label__1
"dont bother with XP: I Have had trouble with HP and XP since upgrading. Although they say it is xp compatable with driver, it is not. Will cause system to lock up and when I called HP they blamed XP. Bought a Epson and first time install without a hitch. Hope this helps and God bless you!",__label__1
"Photosmart pretty dumb: Bought Photosmart 1100 three months ago. Loved it till it thought my color cartridge was bad. Now printer will not recognize any new cartridge. Seems there's a hardware bug that the printer will not reset a flag that indicates failed color cartridge. I've bought 2 new color cartridges and a new black cartridge. Called HP & they had me clean cartridge 3 times, power cycle, and even sent new cartridges. Analyst at HP very nice, thought... still the display flashes ""Color Cartridge Failed"" and ""Replace Color Cartridge"". Won't even print B&W. Dumb thing...",__label__1
"Epson is better and bad software driver: My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115. I paid ~$[money] and he paid only ~$[money] from costco.So, I brought one myself. Epson print better photo than HP 1115.If you think of buying this printer, try Epson first.Also, the driver of HP 1115 doesn't work with my Iomega CR-RW andmy new Epson printer together. Bad software driver!!!",__label__1
"Disappointed: I have used this printer for the last two years, though it has not been heavily used. It has completely broken down, will not acknowledge that it has paper, and the ""carriage"" is broken. It will not feed anything through and constantly has paper jams. I have been told by repair specialists that it will cost several hundred dollars to fix it because the ""carriage"" is so expensive. Though it does print beautiful photos, I am very disappointed with this product's performance over time!",__label__1
"HP workhorse: Great Printer, but does get a bit cranky at times. The 2 side print capability is a plus, saving paper & making printouts more compact. Does a 4 + job on photos, but hard to use the small photo tray. I've used this printer for approx 2 years and just now feel it may be time to upgrade. I feel I made a good choice for my photos.",__label__2
Neat book for starters into continuous-time finance: Very intuitive in explaining the basic concepts and the fundamental and widely used methods in continuous-time finance.

After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say.

"Boring: Who'd Have Thought?: Apart from shrinking core of diehard fans, who is going to buy this? Most of the songs appear on other albums, the liner notes are schmaltzy, the sound quality is not that hot, and BS's voice sounds worn and tired.If she really cared, she would tour with all new songs and sing like she was happy to be there and NOT TALK ABOUT POLITICS. :)For those of you unsure as to whether or not to buy the CD, wait a month and it will be in the cutout bin.I give this 2 stars in honor of the late Mr. Peter Matz, thanked by BS in the liner notes in her usual pompous way.",__label__1

OK.God bless you all and remember wouldn't it be wonderful,If we could all be a little more gentle with each other,and a little more loving,have a little more empathy,and maybe,just maybe we'd like each other a little bit more..........Rock on Barbra Srteisad your the best,and Thank you for all the year's......",__label__2
"Great musice but dissapointed in the actual concert: The music is ok on this, yes her voice isn't what is was in the past but everyone gets older. Still wonderful to hear.I saw Barbra on her first night in Chicago on the 2006 tour and although this fulfilled a lifelong dream of seeing her in concert, I was not at all impressed with her choice of Il Divo. They were overly loud and I hadn't paid $350.00 to see them. And now after seeing clips of Barbra's European Tour shows, I feel robbed. The concert she did in Europe is the one I was hoping for. An entirely different experience and as she will most likely never tour again, there went my one chance to experience Barbra as she should be.",__label__2
"10 Stars at Least!: Brilliant recording, great songs, just enough flavour of the concert without too much talking, not enough singing.

"Streisand:Live in Concert (2 CD's): This is one of the best Barbra has ever done, I have listened to it in full probably ten times since last week when I bought it. It is so incredible.

"AMAZING: I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my CD. I was at the concert in Atlanta and was mesmerized during the entire show. It was so surreal..to be in the company of Barbra and Il Divo. I know the CD will be great. It will be the first thing loaded in my car. And, it will probably stay in there for quite a while. There is and will be no other Barbra. I only wish she would tour more often.",__label__2

"Streisand Live - Amazing: Barbra Streisand for over 46 years has been an entertainer beyond words. Her 2006 tour and subsequent 2007 European tour are sell out sensations. This CD captures part of her performance which is quite powerful. The stage presence alone is numbing, the vocals are rich, deep and so moving. The pairing with Il Divo is fantastic, they have brilliant voices, but are eclipsed by the legend. This is a must have for everyone, especially those who weren't able to see her in concert. What could you want more, how about a DVD to go along with it?",__label__2
"great writing, informative: Every reader of the Frozen Republic will find something to disagree with, but if you have an open mind, you will find that Lazare has many good points about America's government not being the be-all, end-all of democracy.The Frozen Republic is a history of Constitutional (and para Constitutional) problems that America has faced and a description of Constitution worship as America's religion.

However, if plastic isn't an issue for you, this could be your baby.I am disappointed that amazon's normally satisfactory product description process didn't work here. This listing misrepresents the item by failing to mention the non-stainless interior which is a significant fact to many consumers.

I don't believe that they should charge their customers for any shipping or restock fees when they don't describe items honestly. Amazon rocks but this listing needs help!",__label__1

Well, it must be only for coffee beans and only a small amount. The filter holder takes up one side of the container and it's not for the kind of rippled filters that we use. It holds ones that are flat. The person we bought it for ended up using it without the lid for a utensil holder.",__label__1

They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received, since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window, as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding, explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it, so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift.",__label__1
"Great idea--terrible design!: Bought this for my 5 year old Justice Leaguer. My son is not a rough player but we went through 4 (YES, FOUR) of them before we finally got one where the elevator didn't break in the 1st 2 weeks. Mattel needs to get their act together and design toys that have durability. VERY disappointing!",__label__1
"Big Disappointment: I purchased this for my son who is a huge Justice League fan. He gets discouraged because it is always falling apart. I hate it, because I am always putting it back together. I would not recommend anyone buying this toy unless you want to keep putting it together.",__label__1
"Bad Design, just buy the figures: We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas. The elevator uses a string pulley which promptly bound around the gear that connects it to the thumbwheel which raises and lowers the platform. Within 5 minutes of playing, one of the main features broke. Also, the top has a ring with 5 rockets, one of these came missing a retaining pin. Thoroughly disappoingting as he is a big Justice League fan.",__label__1
"Buy your children this toy if you want them to hate you.: This is a huge disappointment for my family, and has forever left a stain on the memory of my son's recent birthday.

And some of the figures don't fit in the elevator.So there it lies, in pieces, in the corner. And here I lie, curled in a ball in the other corner, wondering if I am an inadequate father because I can't make a $40 piece of crap stand up.I hope whoever designed this goes back to creating torture devices.",__label__1
A must for any JL fan: My 3 year old son is OBSESSED with Justice League! Needless to say he HAD to have the watchtower! I too had read the bad reviews and ended up getting it here on Amazon! Yes the three legs don't stay on but after a week of putting them back on a hundred times a day I got out the superglue to secure them on and I have not had a single problem since! Granted you don't want to have to superglue a toy that should work on it's own but if your kid loves JL just buy some glue too!,__label__2
"Don't waste your money: This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy.",__label__1
"A very bad choice: The designers threw in the works and the lone star represents a point for design ingenuity. Problem is this toy is nearly impossible to build and it's more than the comically unreadable directions that are at fault. I have built many a toy but never found one this resistant to having its snap on parts snap on and of course if and when they finally do, the least shake will undo your labor. Sure to end in tears and frustration for all.",__label__1
"A PIECE OF JUNK!: Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash.",__label__1
"Don't waste your money: This toy was not that difficult to put together, but we have to put it back together each time my son plays with it. The set is always falling apart. The elevator broke after the first day. My friend bought this for her son as well, and she is just as frustrated as we are. I would not recommend buying this unless you have hours to spare re-assembly it and keeping up with all the parts that contiunally fall off it. [...]",__label__1
"Not for children to PLAY with!: This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!",__label__1
"Garbage!: My 5 year old son received this as a birthday present, and it is headed right back to the store. The legs do not stay on, it falls over when touched, with or without the legs, there is a missing door, the elevator gets repeatedly stuck. As much as my son loves the idea of this toy, he has given up and resigned to playing with his other toys because this one is garbage, and a pure waste of money.",__label__1
"Frustrating piece of junk - do not recommend!: I bought this for Xmas 2004 after all the clever marketing hype. The rocketship theme looked very cool and rugged in the pictures. However, when my son got it it - it turned out to be nothing but a frustrating, unplayable toy. It falls down constantly because of poor design: the legs can't support the weight of the whole rocket when touching it), the elevator doesn' work (gets jammed all the way up) and it didn't even come with any character figures -these are sold separately! I may have to glue the parts together just so he could play with it some more time before we dump it.Do not recommend!",__label__1
"Not very durable: This toy was a pain to put together, and even worse to stay together. The elevator won't work, and I had to forcefully put some of the pieces together. Most people who reviewed this toy, had the same complaints, but I bought it anyway, because my nephew really wanted it. I'm glad that I only paid $15.00 for it, because it's not worth any more than that. Some pieces came off, before my nephew even got a chance to play with it.",__label__1
"A nice showpiece but falls apart with the slightest touch!: What a colossal disappointment this turned out to be! The Justice League figures are the best superhero figures to come out since the Super Powers figures of the 1980s. They're colorful, durable, playable, and collectible. The Javlin 7 ship is also a nice piece for the Justice League collection. Imagine my disappointment over the Watchtower. While cool to look at, this toy is for display purposes only! As others have noted, it's shaky and falls apart with the slightest touch. What were the designers thinking when they created such flimsy legs for this heavy toy to be supported on? Also, the doors fly open quite easily. This toy will sit on my shelf with all the figures displayed on it. If you have small children avoid this at all cost and save your $35.",__label__1
"Son loves it, but it does fall apart: My son does love this toy and plays with it every day since Santa brought it to him. It has fallen apart each time he plays with it and has fallen on him a couple of times, so if you have a small child, I wouldn't recommend it.I will attempt to GLUE the legs on, since they are the biggest problem for this toy. Everything else works just great. Elevator, noises, guns, etc.",__label__1
Another lame mattel product: Please don't waste your money on this one. My four year old son loves the justice league and thinks this toy is pretty great. The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off.,__label__1
Watchtower is total crap!!: Avoid this toy at all cost. It falls apart when touched. The elevator stopped working almost immediately. Total rip off.,__label__1

"Poor reliability: I have had several of these monitors. I use a two-monitor set-up.-The backlight on the first burned out one month out of warrantee. ViewSonic would not replace the first monitor- fair enough as it was out of warrantee. I purchased a replacement. When it came, the screen was blue, and the color could not be adjusted. ViewSonic sent a replacement which had a green screen, and again, the color could not be adjusted. They were unable to find another VA912b, so they sent a different model to replace it.-Meanwhile, my second monitor, again a VA912b burned out the backlight after less than six months of use.-Beware that the glowing reviews you see for this monitor may not take into account its poor reliability.

"Great book: I'm a big fan of Sohie Kinsella's I consider her one of my favorite writers, and I was so excited when I found this book.

I loved it, it is chick lit and as in most cases is sometimes predictable but I don't care, I still fully enjoyed this.",__label__2
"No Cocktails For Me, Thanks: I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books and her writing style...but this book was awful. The story line was predictable and the writing flat and unoriginal. Makes you wonder if this was truly written by Kinsella or a way for a ghost writer to get started under her 'new' pen name. I don't plan on buying anymore Madeline Wickham books--stick to the original Kinsella, where I haven't been disappointed yet.",__label__1
"Where is her tell-tale wit?!: I was so disappointed with this book! I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's books under the name SK and have read all of them many times, but this was the first book I'd read written under her name Madeleine Wickham. I thought the story was incredibly boring. There is no humor and no one is remotely witty! The characters were all one-dimensional and not lovable at all like her other female heroines. Nothing happened and the pace was unbearably slow. I plan to read other books under the name Madeleine Wickham because the woman herself is a fabulous writer, but I didn't see her regular spark in Cocktails for Three at all.",__label__1

"A harlequin romance for the new age: OK. I picked this up as a light weekend read, not expecting ""War and Peace"" but something fun.This book was as trite as a 1970s Harlequin romance. By the end of the first chapter, I had predicted the character development and plot twists to the very last page. The characters were horribly stereotypical and one-dimenensional. The ""nice girl"", the evil vengenful ""psycho-girl"", the ""I've having an affair with a married man and want some permanence in my life, girl"", the ""torn between job vs family girl""..I could go on forever...The only thing that kept me reading to the end was to find out if my predictions panned out.Also any author who uses the word ""frission"" twice in 10 pages should be locked in a room and required to read Strunk's ""Elements of Style"" until they learn to write beyond a 10 grade level.All in all a waste of my time and the author's.",__label__1
Boring...: I couldn't get into this one. I felt the story was lacking and dragging on. I didn't get through half of it before I gave up.,__label__1

Entertaining Book: It is hard at first to keep all the characters straight but it was a good book. The portrayal of a working first time mom and the two different worlds is insightful. There were a couple surprise twists.,__label__2
"A Fun Read: I didn't realize until I picked up this title at my local Borders that Sophie Kinsella wrote under another name - Madeleine Wickham. What a pleasant surprise!As a fan of the Shopaholic Series, and found this book to actually be more like Sophie's recent title - the Undomestic Goddess. The dialog was witty, yet believable. I found myself wanting to rush in and protect Candice from the evil Heather, comfort Roxanne during her loss, and tell Maggie that everything was going to be alright, and she would adjust to motherhood just fine. As a new mom, I could totally empathize with Maggie and her struggles!I can't wait to read more titles by Madeleine!",__label__2
"A good summer read: This is unlike the other books that i have read so far. the plot revolves around a bar and three best friends. They are good at their jobs,articulate and know what they want from life. But a crazy flat-mate, an affair with a superior and motherhood corode their friendship and their lives-almost. This book is about true friendship and how it can get you through the day and lives problems big or small. A good read that cannot be put down.",__label__2
"hard to read--both format and content: This book is formatted horribly for the Kindle! Never once was the word ""pleasure"" spelled out as one word. ""Plea sure""? Is that a British thing? Many many words where there were mysterious hyphens, words broken into syllables ""so ci a ble"" was one. Doesn't anyone proofread this stuff?Spoiler alert: As far as the book itself, I found the characters to be flat and two-dimensional. Maggie is drinking in a bar at 9 months of pregnancy? Candice despises her neighbor Ed until she has nobody else left in her life, then she's sleeping with him? Roxanne is a homewrecker who gets the home in the end? I dunno, it was really hard for me to want any of these women to succeed. It was like AbFab but without the humor.",__label__1
"A Rare Find - Wonderful!: I've been searching for a book that really makes me laugh, characters I can relate and enjoy and a story that keeps me interested beyond the first 30 pages. Well, I found it! ""Cocktails for Three"" by English author Madeleine Wickham had me completely enchanted. I found the three main characters (Maggie - the pregnant one on maternity leave / Roxanne - the dating a married man one / Candice - the trusting and will do anything for a person in need one) all well rounded and hilarious.""Cocktails"" goes beyond your basic ""friends forever"" novel and dives into real life problems and the effects those decisions have on you and those around you.I found this book really unique and sparkling with touches of really dark and edgy comedy. A great find! I hope others will discover this secret of mine.",__label__2
"A Little Disappointing: I loved all of Sophie Kinsella's books. This book is definitely not as good as the Shopaholic Series. The characters aren't really well-defined, the plot meanders at the end. You can avoid this book and not miss much.",__label__1
"Hated it so much I returned it: I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the ""plot"" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - ""Remember Me"" is hysterical and a great, easy read. ""Cocktails for 3"" is painful trash.",__label__1
"Good chick lit!: This was a very good, fun light read. Very much enjoyed it. Am looking forward to reading more of her books!",__label__2
"Skip it: Three ladies who make sure to have a meeting of the minds every month. The general theme of the book smells of Sex in the City, but for me that was an okay thing to go into as I loved the show (and plan to read the book). So I had some good hopes going into the book. I also was excited because so far I have enjoyed the Shopaholic series, and this is the same Author, different name.Sadly the book did not live up to my hopes. While I love Sophie Kinsella but under the name Madeline Wickham she just falls flat. The book is not nearly as funny as the shopaholic series, and there just seems to be something else missing as well. The women in this book come off as just plain shallow to me. Where while our lovely Shopaholic has issues, she also shows she can be a good human. I just don't see that in Three Cocktails, so in my humble opinion this is a big pass.",__label__1
"Eby dead! 12/27/02: Contrary to Dr. Eby's claim, Jesus did NOT return in his (Eby's) lifetime. FALSE PROPHET ALERT",__label__1
"Encouraging Testimony of Life After Death Experience: This is a fantastic life after death experience written by a physician, whose credentials give greater weight to his testimony. He leads up to this miraculous event by recounting his life experiences, a bit of biography. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it encouraged me tremendously after the recent death of my son, who had also proclaimed his faith in Christ before God took him. I enjoyed the book so much, I read it twice.",__label__2
"Inspiring, but please don't defend fraudulent claims: I went to hear Dr. Eby speak thirty years ago, and at the time I was quite impressed. I bought this book and quickly read it, and was deeply inspired.HOWEVER, I DO remember Dr. Eby quite confidently claim to say that Jesus told him that he would not die before Jesus returned. I remember how it struck me just like the promise that Simeon had about not dying before seeing the Messiah (which he did, when Jesus was presented in the Temple shortly after his birth.)This was not an isolated claim; he made it several times, including shortly before his death in 2002. On the basis of this FALSE claim (unless you believe that Jesus lied to him), I cannot recommend this book, no matter how ""inspiring"" it might be. Dr. Eby was a fraud, pure and simple, and a false prophet. To say otherwise is not to respect the facts.",__label__1
"Very poor condition BUT? Good read!: I saw D. Ebby 35 years ago on the 700 Club, wanted this book for all those years. It was brought to my attention by another minister of the gospel just recently. Saw it on Amazon and decided to buy it, it was inexpensive. The pages fell apart as I read the book, it was extremely frustrating but? So enjoyable and encouraging, I was glad I bought it. I am going to look for the same book in better condition, just to reread or give to another to enjoy.",__label__1
"This book changed my life!: Dr. Richard Eby has experienced many miracles in his life. But his story of life after death changed my life. He falls off a balcony and splits his head open. They rush him to the hospital and thinking he is dead they sew his head up without cleaning the wound. God shows him a glimpse of heaven. Afterwards he cannot remember the the fall. Later God lets him relive the fall to be able to tell others about the experience. A few years later while visiting the Holy Land. He enters the Tomb of Lazarus and everything goes dark. God speaks to him and tells him that he showed him a glimpse of heaven, now he will show him a glimpse of hell. His story is amazing! I saw him on a television show telling his story in 1979. I then went out and bought his book. It gave me the desire to start reading my Bible. Which is the greatest book of all!",__label__2
"An absolutely uplifting book -- an incredible story: One of the better books that I've read over the past year. Dr. Eby provides a biographical review of the miracles that God has performed in his life, beginning with his birth in the pre-depression era through the 1980's. I heard about this book on the radio and it was described as Dr. Eby's trip to heaven after his clinical death due to an accident. What I found was a wonderful collection of stories about how God worked miracles throughout his entire life, including an amazing story of his brief trip to heaven (he describes it in great detail -- I can't wait!) and a brief trip to hell (enough of a description to scare the salvation right into a non-believer). Dr. Eby is a great story teller and the book is very easy to read and enjoy. A very uplifting and ""feel good"" book. A great book to read to kids too!",__label__2
"The Greatest Play on Earth!: I was required to read this play for my ninth grade honors English class. I was expecting it to be a good read, but I found it to be an excellent read! Shakespeare is a true genius. His witty puns and his enthralling details kept me grabbing onto every word. I am a true romantic at heart, and this was a very touching play. The character development and the ironic plot twists are also a very nice touch. If you have never read Shakespeare before, read this and you will be hooked on him forever.",__label__2
"Dark Fantasy with MORALS: I loved this book, because it teaches people why not to have enemies due to consequences. Judging people like saying someone is a dork, jock, etc. could be murderous like in the book they killed themselves. It is realistic but fiction.",__label__2
"My Favorite Shakespeare: The language wraps you up and transports you to a time and land like no other. It's full of love, hate, brutality, and loyalty. All these emotions get tangled up and mixed together. That lends itself to an amazing set of circumstances. There is no greater love story than Juliet and her fair Romeo. All other love stories are measured against this one and you will get lost in this classics story. It's a true classic.",__label__2
as advertised: It was the product my daughter needed for school. I find the book binding rather flimsy but it doesn't need to survive longer than her course and it wasn't expensive so I can't complain.,__label__2

"Feedback: I ordered textbooks for my child's high school classes. I was pleased to receive the books within a short period of time. Also, the books were all in great shape upon arrival! I felt each book that I received was accurately described.",__label__2
Excellent!: My 15 year old daughter is using this for her English/Drama studies. The side-by-side text is a huge help. The information preceding each act is very helpful and interesting as are the comprehension questions at the end of each section.,__label__2
Disappointed: I bought this for the Kindle and there is none of the modern text translation referred to by the other reviews. I am very disappointed because that is the only reason I purchased this book. They should not use printed version reviews for Kindle books.,__label__1
Great Book!: Romeo and Juliet is a wonderful read. I loved reading every minute of it. The summaries and the explanatory notes help you understand everything about it. This is a great book and I would recommend you read this as an introduction to Shakespeare. I did and I am now going to start A Midsummer Night's Dream. Read this book! You'll love every minute of it!,__label__2

"Don't watch this book.: This was by far the worst science fiction novel I have ever watched. While the story of two lovers may seem romantic to some people, the use of spaceships and alien robots was very unneccesairy. The worst part of this play had to be the end where both charaters joined up with Marty McFly to save the universe. Thumbs down to you sir! The remix WAS better.",__label__1
"Never got here.: I can't review this item because it never made it to me. I received an email a few days later saying the money would be credited back to me (which it was). However, I have never had a problem with receiving shipments at my address. The seller claimed that my address was not found. I received something from a different seller just 2 days before though. I am not sure what address they tried to send it to, but it was not the one I gave. Unfortunately I had to find this book somewhere else. The book is a great find, however, and I am very pleased with it.",__label__1
"Great for mature Sixth Graders!: I use Romeo and Juliet as a unit in my literature class, but only when I have a mature class of Sixth Graders. Therefore, I do not use it every year. After a lesson on pronouncing some of the English and what it means, I pick the best readers to do the reading, and switch off daily. We also study the conflicts and do quite an indepth study of the play. They love it!! I end with the Zefferelli version of Romeo and Juliet on Video. The Dover Press edition makes it affordable to buy every student a copy for them to make notes in and keep when we are done!!!",__label__2
"Good, but footnotes are too much.: This version uses footnotes too much. Every little unclear word is attached to a footnote. It's very distracting when reading and takes you away from this book. A lot of the words don't need to be footnoted, I guess the editor thought that the people who would read this would be idiots.",__label__2
"I hate it.: Terrible book. I'm not into classics, so if you're like me, don't buy it. If you like them, buy it.",__label__1
"Great book and all but....: The book unfortunately doesn't have line numbers next to them. Now I'm not sure if this is a bug on my kindle, or if it goes for everybody who has this book, but line numbers aren't there. I need to read this book for school and it would help if there are line numbers for reference. Other than that it is a pretty good book!",__label__2
"Amazing for struggling readers: I ordered this book for my 9th grade regular students for learning Romeo and Juliet. It has the Shakespeare version on one side and the plain English translation on the other. It really helped some of my lower level students get involved in learning the play instead of getting discourage because they didn't understand the language. I highly recommend this product, especially for struggling readers.",__label__2

Romeo & Juliet: Experienced no problems with the order. The book came within the estimated delivery date. The book matched the description given.,__label__2
Complex Love: I have seen all movie versions about Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and still love the book everytime I revisit the story. Every word captivates the reader into truly feeling the passion and tragedy of these two lovers. Even a character such as Tybalt Capulet won me over as far as description goes. Shakespearian writing is very much complex and confusing but it has a touch romance and anger which adds to the emotion of the story. Read this classic tragedy!,__label__2
"Very Disappointed: I bought this book based on the other reviews saying how useful having the interpretations on the opposite page was. In reality it starts and ends directly with the play. No prologue, introduction or anything else. The reviews don't correspond to the item being sold.",__label__1
"Not Impressed: This book does not have line numbers. In addition, the pages don't have the scene or act number on them. So when you open up the book, you have no idea where you are in the play. You have to flip through pages and find the closest scene 1 so you can figure out which act you are in and then go from there. This book makes it difficult to follow with others in class and I would not recommend it to anyone.",__label__1
"Very difficult to hear: If you are a teacher, I would look into buying another audio version of Romeo and Juliet. I have been using it as a tool to get the students to hear professional actors and to then ask them to use the same skills those professional actors use (inflection, emphasis, etc.) The problem is it is VERY difficult to hear...to the point that you have to sit 3 feet away to hear it at times. This simply does not work for a classroom.",__label__1
"Literary junk food for the masses: Plain and simple - Shakespeare sold out.*R&J* is simply sensationalist trash. It contains a good portion of Shakespeares worst verse and insipid characterizations. It's unchallenging, crude, and simply melodrama for the most part. It's the Shakespearean equivalent of ""Party of Five"" and the Spice Girls.The only saving grace of this ""play"" (why not call it a ""B-play?"") is the beautiful soliloquy by Mercutio about Queen Mab.The rest is absolute garbage.Read a real play. ""Hamlet,"" although dreadfully overplayed, is a fine work. So is ""Caesar.""And forget Shakespeare. There are other fine Elizabethan writers who have been forced to exist in the ""Bard's"" shadow. Had Marlowe lived, we wouldn't have even known about Shakespeare. And Donne finally been recognized for the genius that he is.",__label__1
"Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story review: As I didn't liked the story at all I cant say lots of things about it but if I had to rewrite the book, I would do it in modern English. Old Englih is one of the reasons I didn't liked the book. Another reason is that is a very predictable story and it has only 2 themes: Romeo and Juliet's love and the war between their families. For me Romeo is the worst character because he only thinks about Juliet and kissing her.These and much more are the reasons of why I didn't liked the story",__label__1
stupid student review by gabriel c: Romeo and Juliet is a story about to lovers that meet at first sight. The biggest problem they have together is that both of the families have been fighting and hate each other since they both have been born. It all started when Romeo been depressed ever day moping around and feeling sad all of the time because he loved Rosaline and she did not love him back. So one day Romeos cousin told him about this party and that Rosaline would be there so they left and Romeo saw Juliet there and followed her to her house and both exchanged thoughts about each other and decided that they will get married but secretly. So they had to come up with a plan to pretend that Juliet was died so the can get married and the planned failed and they both ended up killing themselves. Play was very stupid it sucks no one should read it because there is no point of reading this because all this play is taking up your time.,__label__1

"Signet Shakespeare Kindle verions: To be completely honest, I have only examined the sample for this e-text of Romeo and Juliet. It was a very unhelpful sample, giving a selection of the introductory essay about Shakespeare's life and times.So I scoured the review page. None of the reviews I looked at are actually for the e-version of this book. They were written for a variety of paper versions of the book, good, bad, and ugly. Some are about a specific used book purchased, others are about the play itself (love it/hate it). None of them help determine the value of this specific e-version of the play.Bottom line, I refuse to pay $4.99 for a version that I can't get any information about. How does it look on the page? Are there additional annotations beyond the essay about Shakespeare's life and times? Are there links to acts or scenes? Are there line numbers?",__label__1

The lines are not numbered, so students will have to number the lines as homework for every scene, or else you'll waste a lot of class time doing this.2. The paper quality is terrible for annotating: Mechanical pencil lead gets caught on the fibers, and any ink but ballpoint pens spreads out.3. Very few terms are annotated in the book, so you'll need to keep your own glossary inside the front cover because there's very little space to annotate.4. Prestwick House has an annotated copy with line numbers, plenty of space in the margins, high-quality paper, scene-by-scene glossary in the back, reader's tips for reading Shakespeare, and extra textbook-type help.

"Basic Romeo and Juliet: I am a high school English teacher looking at the different versions of classics texts available for Kindle (fire), so my review will not be for the play itself, but rather for the eBook--readability, layout, price, and other features.This 99 cent version is very basic. It has the complete text of the play, but that's about it. It does not have any chapter select links to either act or scene, and no line numbers are provided. There are no notations or explanations. The layout does maintain the iambic pentameter poetry, but the text appears crowded on the page as there is no line break or spacing between speakers.At 99 cents, this version is not bad; however, there are better, equally inexpensive versions.",__label__1

"R&J-Summary By EricaH: Romeo & Juliet is a romance novel. It's a story that will make your heart sink. This magnificent couple had such a strong love for each other. It was so strong that they died together. In the beginning it was crazy how they are enemies and they want to be together but it's hard to because what they are doing is wrong to their families. At the ending they died together with their love stronger than ever, it's a heartbreaking story, wishing that they would live happily ever after.I really enjoyed this story, although I do wish that they could have lived to be together and in love.",__label__2

"The Best Review Ever Seen: Alejandro and Martin.After reading `Romeo and Juliet', we noticed the difficult vocabulary that Shakespeare used. It makes it difficult to follow the story because Shakespeare plays with words and even invented some expressions.We like a few characters like Mercutio, because of his sexual jokes and language. Another character that we enjoyed was The Nurse, because of her fun-loving personality. The dirty sexual humor was very unexpected and, very funny.We found strange that the prohibited love of Romeo and Juliet was not because one family was in a poor social position, but because the two families fight for their own power. We also liked its end, when Romeo and Juliet died. It's surprising because we all expect a happy end with Romeo and Juliet's marriage.In conclusion, we found the story very interesting and surprising.",__label__2
"A Fine Work: Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much ""haste"". After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you. I look foward to reading more of Shakespeare's plays in the near future.",__label__2

Here are some things that confuse me:*How did this feud really begin?*Why can't this story end in happily ever after?*Why does Lady Capulet have to be so stuck up on everybody?*Why couldn't Shakespeare have written in a language we could all understand?*Why does everybody have to jump to conclusions?I simply can't understand why people love this play so much.

Think of it as muzak that is likely played at Club Med resorts or Sandals resorts to vacationers who find Club Med still suitable (as if it somehow ever was). South Beach, Monaco, Cannes sur Mer or St. Tropez discrimnating tastes this is not.I will say that it does have packaging and style over substance, but beyond that, there are far superior products out there, literally for a fraction of the cost.

"Very Thorough, yet Tough to Read: Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization.

When they get to the site they discover something they never could have imagined. There really is not much to say about this movie. The best way to explain it is that this is a Scy/Fy channel version of ""Predators"". It is only missing the effects, action, cool bad guys and acting, other then that it is a lot like ""Predators"".

"Protect a bed mattress cover: I purchase a Protect-A-Bed mattress cover at a mattress store, salesman said to wash it twice prior to use. He did not say to dry it with towels and sheets. Its supposed to be waterproof, one of our cats proved its not, contacted company, they asked if dried on medium with towels and other bedding, I said no, no one told me and not anywhere on package does it state needs to be protected in the dryer. Company sent another cover,this time on low setting which is mostly air fluff with towels and other sheets and it was scorched in 3 places. Both were scorched on medium and low heat, dryer is electric which is not as hot as gas. I'm getting my $90 back that I was charged at a mattress company. Not worth the money if you can't dry it because it has cheap plastic backing.",__label__1
Fabulous: I bought the pillow covers and the mattress covers and they are great. They wash and dry well and do exactly the job they should.....protecting pillows and mattresses.,__label__2
"Bad cutting and way too big: It's definitely not having the cutting as shown on the model. I ordered size M as that's suggested on the the manufacturer's site for size 6. It's way too big. I exchanged it for size S. I have 36"" breast and 26"" waist and it's still way too big.The cutting is very bad as well. It's just a giant piece of flat cloth and they didn't have the shape for cups. Thus once you tie up at the back, you will have a weird surplus of fabric underneath your boobs. Very ill fitting.",__label__1
"Doesn't fit well/hard to take off: I decided to return this outfit because I did not have time to try and pin up the polka dot underskirt to make it look like the model's costume. The underskirt hangs 2-3 inches below the top layer making the outfit look frumpy. The underskirt is sewn onto some black fabric that can be tucked up around the waist, but it doesn't stay there (and it makes your waist look bunchy).The laces are cute but are a pain to tighten to get the outfit to mold to my body (reference, I bought an x-small since I'm 5'4"", weigh 104 lbs). Also, this outfit is extremely hard to take off, which makes a romantic night in rather difficult. Plus, I didn't want to have to put in bra cups to give me some curves up top. The cut of the top made me look flat (34B). I think this would work well for busty girls.The material of the costume is of the quality I expected for this type of thing. Overall it was cute--but it just looks so much better on the model.",__label__1
"Not cut well: This costume is poorly cut. Areas through the bust/underarms bunch up and won't lay flat. I have an average build -- not flat, and not busty (35 B/C). I ordered an XS. But while the waist fit, the bust area was tight and dug into the underarms.",__label__1
"hmm...: I bought this costume in hopes of wearing for Halloween ( last year). I had even separately purchased the duster ( which I am now using to really dust things). Uhh... I tried it on ( I got a X-Small) and its just big... the net piece ( part of the dress with the dots) go all the way down to almost my knees. Which makes it awkward and not sexy at all- its just weird I tried tucking the net part in to my undies to hold it, but it just becomes supper puffy- again looks weird. I never wore it and its still brand new sitting in my closet somewhere.Maybe its just for my body- I am not sure, but the material isn't as great either compared to the picture. Def. does not look anything close to how the model looks in it.Sorry- this was not a good buy at all. The model sure looks good in it.",__label__1
"Cheap: This was a gift, but the fabric was cheap and didn't look great on or last well. However It was fun, and I got compliments on it all night.",__label__1

"Hands-Down Yello's Finest Album: I've been a Yello fan since Solid Pleasure's release and I've experience the best (One Second, Claro Que Si) and worst (Zebra) of what this group has to offer. One Second is the pinnacle of their work and is one of my all-time favorite albums ever.Even though this album is getting on in years, the sounds and rhythyms remains timeless...both dark and tenebrous as well as hypnotic and majestic. ""Santiago"" finds (and keeps) the groove of all grooves, ""Moon On Ice"" drips with atmosphere, and ""Call It Love"" sports an excellent guitar hook. Even the repeat track ""Oh Yeah"" (previously on Stella), fits in with the entire composition.This album is sheer genius and belongs in any music lover's collection.",__label__2
"The album divine: This album is the best of Yello's earliest albums. My favourite song is Si Senor The Hairy Grill, but Call It Love is also good as well as Goldrush, Dr Van Steiner, The Rythm Divine and L'Hotel. I havn't quite get used to the other songs (as you often have to do with Yello's songs). Buy this album!",__label__2
"Unevenly Fantastic: This album has some of the most fascinating,bizarre sound at some points and other songs are flat out boring. Si Senor The Hairy Grill being the masterpiece of the bunch with an organ biuldup to an amazing crescendo of screaming guitars (or is it just screaming?). Dr. Van Steiner, Goldrush, the latin~tinged La Habanera, and to a lesser extent, Oh Yeah, are all fine, and incredibly inventive tunes. Shirley Bassey is great in the Rhythm Devine, but the rest is a tad blah. Still worth it for all the greatness, and was a must buy for me as I used to have it in the 80's and really missed it. Jamming out to Si Senor was worth it all.",__label__2
"One second, Forever: Great tunes dripping with latin up beat melodies and smooth syncopation. One track could have easily appeared in a 007 flick.Slick production and sound makes for great party music ; dancing or sitting ! ""Oh yeah"" will always turn an ear with or without the accompaning movie.......",__label__2
"One of the most innovative Cd's of all time.: Take time to listen to the samples [....] If you do not own this album, then get it. Get it any way you can. The music is beyond innovative. The sounds remain timeles. If you are going to have a party get this CD. Your friends will love it. I personaly have thousands of Cd's and this is by far one of the most important ones. Just listen to it. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.",__label__2
"Hypnotic sounds abound on this great Yello CD: This is one of my favourite Yello albums. It is inventive, amusing, creative and fun to listen to. Some of the songs are very moody and atmospheric, others are upbeat. It's better than older Yello in my opinion and a good place to start if you are new to their sound.",__label__2
book review: This book does not have the most up-to-date photography but they are good enough and the general sentiment and prose are very nice. It gracefully combines science with the wonder of it all which makes a lovely combination. I had it 26 years ago when I was pregant and still recommend it.,__label__2
"Know what is happening inside you: Pregnancy can be a very long wait. This book helps a lot by giving you a month by month accounting of what is happening in the development of the baby, both in words and with awesome photos.Highly recommend for any new mom-to-be.",__label__2
"1962 version bothered me: I have several fetal development books now, but this one is the only one I couldn't stand to keep. I tore out a few of the best pictures and threw the rest of the book away. I had the 1962 version, so I can't speak for any other editions. It explains in the book that the picture sequences documenting the development of movement were of babies born very early, as early as the 6th week. I don't believe they were aborted on purpose or anything, but I couldn't stand to see how they were being touched with a hair to see how they move... that seems cruel to me. That sort of thing is not what I want to see when I'm expecting! The authors other book, Beginning Life is much, much better. It has better pictures and is more sensitive to the well-being of the pictured fetuses.",__label__1
"Great Book - A must for every pregnant woman!: This is the same book I looked at every week when I was pregnant, and now my granddaughter is using it! Awesome!",__label__2
"I did not give it a good review at first however, they promised but did not deliver my money back.: I would have like to have seen this book before I bought it. I never would have bought it in the condition I found it.",__label__1
"A bit disappointed: While there were some nice pictures and helpful information I was abit disappointed with the book in general. It was short (92 pages of large text),with no color pictures and just didn't seem like that helpful of a book for a first time mother. The book was first published in 1962 with an update in 1982 and I'm sure there have been quite a few new discoveries that would be quite informative for a first time mother since then. I felt like I was reading a high school biology book. OK for what it was but I'd not recommend it.",__label__1
"Another masterwork: Jerry Goldsmith created soundscapes that sometimes surpassed the films they were written for in evoking emotions and revealing character. For Logan's Run, Goldsmith came up with one of his most brilliant creations. It opens with stark, electronic sounds, effectively mirroring the cold future society depicted in the film. Only when Logan breaks out of the domed city and into the natural world does Goldsmith allow the full orchestra to come in, warming up the music just as Logan's worldview expands. This release finally captures the full range and power of the score in pristine sound. And, heck, I even like the Love Theme tacked on at the end...",__label__2
"Logan's Run-Limited Edition: I've always been a fan of film scores, and I've wanted this one on CD for a long time. I got the LP version when the film was first released & still have it. What makes this CD special is the fact that there are alternate selections included that were not part of the original CD release, and that this release was limited to 3,000 copies. I've been enjoying it very much!",__label__2
Wonderful soundtrack: This soundtrack is amazing. Nice music from Jerry Goldsmith. Very hard to find CD. One of his best soundtracks ever made. When you find it buy it.,__label__2
"Informative and entertaining to read: For the fact that the book was written just a few years after Li's death, information was fresh and probably quite accurate. I just wish that the book has a lot more photos. I enjoyed reading it.",__label__2
Lacking: This book lacks the depth it seems to promise. Some of the illustrations are lacking. There is not enough meat to help anyone with special needs learners. I would suggest you look elsewhere. I was greatly disappointed since the majority of work by Jensen is wonderful.,__label__1
"Had to buy this for a class-- not very informative: The chapters are set up like a pamplet with bulleted information. It just doesn't seem appropriate for a college class. It is written like a middle school textbook, and it doesn't offer more information than what most laymen already know.",__label__1
too old: Written in 1970's it's really too old to apply to todays lifestyles and trends on fry cookery but it does have some classics. Glad I bought it used-but shipping was more than the price!,__label__1
"Invaluable: The chapters on ""Genuine Encounter"" and ""I-Messages"" are worth reading again and again. Although this book is old, the messages are fresh today. I see parents every day who do not enjoy their children; this book encourages you to appreciate your children every day - a great gift.",__label__2
"Harmful self esteem advice for 10% of the population: Avoid this book on the basis a dated and harmful passage on page 144 that states that homosexuality is ""related to a failure in identification"" and that parents of homosexual children should ""seek professional help at the earliest possible moment"". Their view of the cause of homosexuality is out of mainstream thought, and it implies that something wrong happened. The main reason for need for any counseling would be if homosexuality is causing adjustment or self-acceptance problems. This is not what the author's have in mind. Following the author's advice fails to honor your childs true nature, and certainly would be detrimental to the development of his/her self esteem.",__label__1
"FORGET PAGE 144: I have read this book and it offers excellent advise for parents. Several reviewers here have pointed out the authors ""outdated"" views on homosexuality - this is their opinion. Homosexuality is definitely an identity crisis and professional help should most definitely be sought immediately. There should be no doubt that individuals with a gay or bisexual agenda wrote the careless and irresponsible comments above. On the whole, the book is excellent. If you don't agree with page 144 just tear it out and your done.",__label__2
"Good: It was a good book with a good lesson. I just prefer 1,2,3 Magic (Effective Discipline for Children 2-12) by Thomas W. Phelan, PhD.",__label__2
"Bone chilling outdated views: I was just about to buy this book for my child bearing friend when I saw the outdated view to homosexuality. Pitty. This book is very good in many espects; but in the event of the child or anyone close to the family being homosexual, this will probably result in parent's mishandling of the situation which will perhaps do a good deal of damage to the child's self esteem.",__label__1
"VERY Old Fashioned Views of Men and Women and Homosexuality: While this book contains many helpful explanations of what to expect as your children grow it also contains WILDLY outdated depictions of men and women. Women are only described as working in the home - cleaning and baking. Men are described as working ceaselessly outside the home and having no time for children. The book was originally written in the 70s and it shows!In today's world where 70% of women work outside the home I found these depictions off-putting. I mean, wow, when I was a kid (and i'm 45) my mom worked outside the home.The greatest ding against the book though, is it's offensive depiction of homosexuality as a condition worthy of 'immediate psychological attention'. I am not gay, am married and have two children but if either of my sons are gay, I will support them and their choices with all my heart - not send them to a psychiatrist!",__label__1

"Two sides to every coin: 'The most dangerous man alive'? Doubtful...more like an individual who proves how influential environment is on forming of human character. If you read this book and don't in some small way sympathize with the human being that is Charles Manson then you're less human than the 'monster' he is purported to be. Inevitably there is bias and self indulgent perspectives conveyed here; the writing is relatively average as well though it flows smoothly & does compel one to turn the page, even with droopy eyelids. At least it is an answer to the best seller written by the man who was most instrumental in putting Manson behind bars; at most it's as close to a confession the literary world will probably ever see from Mr. Manson.",__label__2
"""Manson"" -Not in his own words by a long shot: Nuel Emmons, ex-con, aspiring journalist and two-faced acquaintance of Charlie, covers no new ground in this book.Emmons states himself in the preface that he wasn't allowed to take notes or record Charlie during his interviews with the famous prisoner. Therefore, the title is misleading. It should read ""Manson, in Emmons' words"". More of the same rhetoric espoused by Bugliosi and the establishment.For a better, fresher look at Manson- check out ""Charles Manson Superstar"" on VHS.",__label__1
"I don't believe Manson had anything to do with this.: Ok, if your a Manson collector of course you have to have this, but otherwise it is not even a good read, let alone Manson's words.Buy it if you are collecting, but read Helter Skelter or the Family for a better read.",__label__1
"totally untrue: ""Charles Manson in Nuell Emmons's Words"" anyone who's seen or heard Manson interviewed, knows his lingo and knows those aren't his words.",__label__1
"Most Dangerous Man Alive...Yeah right!: To label Charles Manson ""The Most Dangerous Man Alive"" is a farce. He is now a rambling senile idiot/inmate stored away at San Quentin. He is better known as a prolific liar than a prolific writer. This book well written, therefore it could not have come from his words or hands. Then again, he has always used others to do his bidding via murder or writing. Believe what you want but I believe it is pure horse manure, although entertaining.",__label__1
"Fabrication... Squeezing the cash out of MAC...: I've communicated with Charlie on more than one occasion.The man does not write nor talk like this book reads.End of story.However, his written word is legible, unlike what someone wrote in their review, some of it is a little hard to read because he's about 71 years old now and I would imagine his hands tremble a bit...But about this book...Waste of money.The ReVeReNd",__label__1

I THINK NOT: I HAVE READ ALL MEDIA EXPOSED IDEAS OF THE STORY OF MANSON AND HIS SO CALLED FAMILY.I JUDGE ALL AS HUMAN FIRST AND ALL OTHER THINGS ON CHARACTER.I NEVER BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A HIPPIE CULT LEADER,NOT THAT HE FORMED THIS FAMILY, AND BELIEVE HE KILLED NO ONE.THIS WAS JEERED BY MANSON HIMSELF BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CLOSEST REVELATION TO EXPOSE THE WAY IT CAME ABOUT OUT OF THE MEDIA.1967, MANSON ASKED NOT TO GO TO SOCIETY.HE MET FEW INSTRUMENTAL PEOPLE HE HUNG OUT WITH. HE WAS SHY OF SEX. HE WAS IGNORANT AS TO HOW THINGS WERE. HE WAS INTO BING CROSBY, NOT BEATLES AND HELTER SKELTER.ONE OF THE GIRLS CREATED THAT BY HERSELF.IF IT HAD STAYED IN WHAT WAS HIS RELEASE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN O.K. BUT TOO MANY PEOPLE JOINED THEM AND THE LOVE AND PEACE ERA, REVOLVED TO BIKERS, WEAPONS ,THEFTS. THAT WAS NOT THE PLAN. TRYING TO KEEP UP EXSISTANCE, SOME PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY.

"WHAT??? GIVE ME A BREAK!!!!: Hell, I'm not even going to read this book before I tell you all what I think! No reason to waste my time reading ANYTHING written by an animal like Manson.I'm kind of in to learning more about infamous cases like Manson's...but I'd like to hear THE TRUTH about what happened. And the criminals themselves usually do NOT tell the truth. They usually do have a way of detaching themselves, if you will, from the identity they had when they committed or instigated whatever the heck the crime was. So if I read on one of the reviews, that it doesn't sound like Manson...Gosh, why on earth am I not surprised!Hey...for a good laugh, I guess this would be OK to read...just to see how a beast like Manson operates.But I give this one star...like I said, consider the sanity of the source of information in this book...and do your best to not believe it unless someone in their right mind can confirm it.Otherwise, enjoy!",__label__1
"Manson... in someone else's words: While this is a fairly well written book anyone that has ever been connected to Manson, Manson's followers, or the Manson case has said there was no way that Charles Manson had ANYTHING to do with this book.First of all, Manson, while speaking makes NO sense whatsoever.Secondly, If anyone has ever seen Manson's written word, not only does it not make any sense, but it's not legible.Third, The ""frame"" that the wording is in, does not sound like anything I have ever seen, read, or heard from Manson.Fourth, Manson himself has denied having anything to do with this book since it was being written, through publication, through all the years since.Some of the information in this book is factual, based upon trial transcripts, and conversations that are documented elsewhere. However the words that are attributed to Manson, in my opinion were the author's own words. Not a bad read, but not something I would recommend to someone looking for the 'truth'.",__label__1
"excellent find: very interesting book. was one of those you do not want to put down. it gave a different perspective of the happenings of the manson family. however, one must keep in mind it was recorded from what charles manson believed happened. great book.",__label__2
"a greater understanding of a sick mind: Nuel Emmons is the author, so these are his words. He only translates into readable print what Charles Manson is trying to relate to us. I have no sympathy for Manson, being where he is, as he is a grown man and is responsible for his own actions. He cannot blame his childhood for the mistakes he made as an adult.However, I do feel sorry for Charles Manson, the child. Growing up, he was totally confused, and I do have sympathy for him at that stage of his life. However, anyone with even a SHRED of common sense, knows you cannot think like the adult Manson and get away with it for long.",__label__2
"Manson Shows True Power Over His ""Family"": Manson shows it power and raps about his feelings over what really happend in 1969. In my opionion this book was chilling and addicting. If you want to witness the true power of manson and is words, read this book",__label__2

"What's New Pussycat?: I first heard Miss Kittin (or Caroline Herve) on Felix Da Housecat's album `Kittenz and Thee Glitz' where her deadpan vocals dominated `Silver Screen Shower Scene', the best song on that album. She is also from that same electroclash scene as Chicks on Speed and Tiga.`I Com' is her second album and is more club-friendly then her previous outing. The beats are more in your face and her sense of irony is stronger, with track 2 `Requiem for a Hit' in particular standing out. First half of the album is excellent, it does takes some more listens to get into the second half. Another good reason for owning this album is the inclusion of the video for `Professional Distortion'. An album for the suicidegirls.com generation.",__label__2
"Pretentious Drivel: People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this.",__label__1
"so many good music out there, why wasting our time and money: As somebody else wrote earlier, it is so much great music out there that these I.Com tracks sound awfully poor and dry to me; maybe if that album would have appeared in the 90s it'd have sounded slightly more surprising, but just a few weeks before Björk releases Medulla, and definitely late after the Chicks on Speed albums (and without even 10% of their musical imagination) Miss Kittin with her new release is making electronic music sound like a joke, and conceived for people who never heard about Warp, Rephlex and the intelligent vast worlds of true electronica. To avoid.",__label__1
"Don't listen to that bad review!!: I thought twice about buying this because of that horrible review... SOOOO GLAD i got this cd now! Way better music and more singing less ""talking"" (talk/singing-samples). Miss kitten shows us that she can make more than electroclash and techno beats. Other than #2 (dance) and #4 (rock)this cd is more TRIP HOP than anything. While i would never compare it to baxter or dot allison I WOULD say many of those fans might like this. Much more intelligent and sad feeling than album 1, not as dancy.",__label__2
"Ms Kittin, always on the cutting edge.: I have been waiting a long time for this record and although I love Miss Kittin, I must admit I did not enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Radio Caroline 1.

"Cheating: David Weber uses a trick in this book that I think is cheating at writing, and not in a good way. One chapter ends with the main characters in dire straits, and then the next one starts with them having overcome the problem without any explanation. Did he get tired of writing or is he just inept?Otherwise I'd say that I would recommend the book to readers age 12-16. To an adult the characters seems a trifle ""fantastic"".",__label__1
Three Great Books in One!: Empire From the Ashes tells a great story. This reprint worth buying if you don't already own the three paperback versions. Where's the fourth book? I've put it on my list of Weber books worth waiting for.,__label__2
"the nay-sayers are nuts: I've been reading SF for just over 65 years. My SF library runs to 1800 volumes. While Empire From the Ashes may have been one of Weber's early works, it simply sparkles with imagination. If you don't enjoy it, find another genre to read. He has grown greatly in the conversations between characters (in Safehold, they are amazingly good), but they are just fine in the Dahak trio. I have recently finished reading Asamov's Foundation pentology (including the Robot inclusions) and six of Heinlein's best. Neither of them can touch Weber's attention to detail, and INTELLIGENT conversations between characters who are at the top of Safehold's heirarchy and therefore intelligent. The monologues are so good they can bring an unexpected lump in the throat. If all you want is car-chase type reading, you may skip pages, but if you want a brilliant read from a great SF writer, Weber is your guy.",__label__2
"Talk about Twists and turns...: It was a pretty good Sci Fi book. When taken as a series, there are some great twists and turns. I liked the bio-enhancements that the characters get. The concept is very interesting to think about. There is a theory on how the human race came to earth, as well as a war going on in space unknown to those on earth. I think that any Sci Fi fan will enjoy reading this story.",__label__2
"What an enjoyable read.: One of the Best Books for an introduction to Sci/fi writing. When I first read this book years ago I said that to a friend of mine, and it still holds true today. One of the very few books i will read over again every year or two. Thankfully its just as good then as well. If you want an enjoyable read, that leaves you smiling at the end this is it.",__label__2
"How many times have I read this?: I really don't know.Just finished re-reading it again, and still cried in parts, and was still left with a broad smile at the very end. (Like other readers, my paperback versions no longer have covers, and even this hardback is getting beaten up)The only disappointing part is that he isn't still writing in this universe.I asked him about it when I saw him at a convention in Denver a few years ago, and he said that this universe was pretty tied up at a good stopping point, and that he has so many other projects that he is less likely to go back to it.

Great concepts throughout, makes me want to get out the telescope and look at the moon again and say ""what if"".Weber's style reminds me of WEB Griffin or Beowulf - each chapter peeking in on an hour in the action, spread over months or years, villains or heros dispatched with alacrity and gore.

"One of the Top Ten for any Gnostic Library: THE SECRET BOOKS OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICS by Jean Doresse is another great scholarly work free from ""New Age"" claptrap & commercialist distortion. The book is particularly relevant as French author Doresse was literally one of the first Westerners to actually see the original Nag Hammadi texts discovered in 1947. Although Doresse is a Christian proponent with a thinly veiled hostility to Gnostic tradition, he provides a wealth of reference material and, like Kurt Rudolph, indicates a possible interaction with Gnostic beliefs and Paganism--particularly in Alexandria, the motherland of Gnostic Paganism. This book is a MUST READ for any serious student of the origins and practices of Gnostic Philosophy.Gospel of Judas and Other Gnostic Secrets Revealed",__label__2

Spanish 10-11th century illumination is quite separate and unique from the rest of Europe using lively imagery, repeating patterns and vivid color combinations.

An extremely good picture book.: The photos of the book are breathtaking and the book gives a good overview of Celtic art spanning the Celtic period. However the reader should bear in mind that the book is not comprehensive. Books available in German such as the Praehistorische Bronzefunde series give one a glimpse as to how wildly creative the Celts were especially in all of the art in general of Hallstatt period and of the variety of of styles found on fibula in the La Tene period. I highly recommend one with a serious interest in Celtic art to continue to search for more source material in addition to this book. However if one were to own one book as an overview of Celtic art I would recommend this book as one of the books to have.,__label__2

"Excellent novel with a different focus: Venus Johnson seems to have is going on. SHe has a good career, a doctor for a boyfriend and long pretty hair. But she is not happy. Venus decides to make some changes and the first thing to go is the boyfriend, then the hair. Cutting off the hair is not easy. As any black woman can tell you, its hard being a slave to the hair. You know the horror stories, of the pressing comb, perms, and hours at the hair salon, but it seems your hair can dictate your self worth. This was happening with Venus. It was fun to read the reactions of others to her new look, new attitude. I found this book to be very interesting. THe characters were funny, interesting and someone you know you already know. It was also encouraging to watch Venus come to terms with herself, her life and her relationships. This was a very interesting read. One I highly recommend",__label__2
"More than just hair: The author is smart. If you name a book, ""Nappily Ever After"" you're gonna trick hair conscious women (which is practically every woman) into reading your novel. But is it really about hair?The basis is about hair but the message the author is trying to convey is about finding who you are and being comfortable with that. The author is a very good writer and storyteller. She took a very basic idea and made it into a very entertaining story with a lesson. A lot of people can't do that very well. It's just a simple lesson that most women can relate too. Nothing deep or philosophical (we have Octavia Butler for that) but a lesson about being comfortable with who you are.I give it 4 stars: It's a nice story.... good airplane read, poolside read, whatever. I just don't care for the characters that much. Kandi and Clint are really mean.",__label__2
"Kept my interest: ""Nappily"" was entertaining!. However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves. Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her ""finding herself"" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this. We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.The book's opening left you ""hanging"". I surprised by the ending. I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?). I was not bored!",__label__2

"Uneven: While the author does a good job of illustrating the personal ""good hair vs. bad hair"" trauma of black girls everywhere (myself included), too much of this novel is bogged down in romance novel cliches to make the overall plot resonate.",__label__1
"Disappointed: I was very disappointed with the book because it touched on a lot of issues that we as black women deal with, but it never really addressed them. The title is very misleading and to me doesn't even really match with the storyline. I got the impression that maybe as she was finishing the book she got tired and kind didn't really put forth an effort to give the book a meaningful ending. I was very disappointed with the ending and thought it could have been much better. The rest of the storyline jumped around and the plot just didn't make a lot of sense at times - what one thing had to do with another wasn't clear. Like I said, the book touched on a lot of good issues, but provided no good resolution for the characters.",__label__1
"a very poor attempt!!: This book is basically a bunch of recycled self help ideas tossed at the AA woman under the guise of a catchy title. I didn't make it half way and had to throw it down vowing not to crack the cover of that mess again. That book was rambling and was boring about the same old crap. Man problems, looks, and nothing about real feelings. It's just not my type of book. If you have just gotten out of a bad relationship like this one, then this book is for you. But for those who are not, move on down the cyber shelf!!I heard about this book on different AA hair discussion boards.

She had finely textured hair, for goodness sakes! She was even compared to Jada Pinkett by one of her close friends! The title was a ..., and I felt cheated as I read the book. As a matter of fact, I skipped to the end. Don't buy it, rent it from the library if you must.",__label__1
"Not exactly what I expected........: but I had to make the time to finish the book to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. At times I felt there was something else that needed to be said to complete the story. Maybe for me, the author should have started with some background, instead of when the character cut off her hair, and then after she cut her hair she should have made her proud and not afraid of what others had to say about her, this should have been about her feelings and only about her feelings about her hair.",__label__2
"thought provoking: I read this book for the second time, this time with my bookclub and I have to up my rating, one whole star. Talking about this book in a group with women who have experienced the same feelings as Venus and Kandi was an enlightening experience. I can see where the author was going with the faulty ending. I can respect her choice for giving Clint to the other woman. Sometimes life happens that way and isn't truth stranger than fiction.",__label__2
"Well written and kinda true!!!: This book had a lot of truth to it. A lot of us women take our issues to our hair, and it is not an ethnic thing. Tyson Edwards, the egocentric character, had it pinned just right. However, I was a little miffed that Venus Johnston, who had it going on in every other respect, had to feel that she needed to do something drastic to bring distinction to herself. I really don't think cutting her hair was going to have much of an impact like she thought it would. I understood her plight with Clint Fairchild, but rushing him wasn't going to make it happen any better or sooner. The character I really felt sorry for was Kandi, she was in a no good triangle with one man and then got involved as the rebound with another. She was the one that should have cut her hair off. Trisha Thomas did a dynamite job with bringing this to full circle for us and showing that a woman doesn't have to rely on her vanity to make it in life.",__label__2
"Very good book!: This book was breath taking. Trisha did an outstanding job in writing this story. I enjoyed reading this book. Although I read this book 3 months ago, I still can remember how everything took place in the end. I recommend this book to all my friends, loved ones, and family members. It is definitely something to keep on the shelf.",__label__2
"NItty Gritty-This book gets to it...: Nappy... this book gets down to the nitty gritty. Venus and Kandi are so real. I could see myself in both characters. I think many black women are like Venus, independent, take charge, and wish or have tried (as I have) cutting their hair off. Kandi, on the other hand, is what we have to at least appear to be to black men so that we are considered attractive- long hair, sexy, somewhat dependent, emotionally needy, and not intimidating. If you want to read a book that is not only pleasurable to read, but infused with a realistic look at the lives of young black women then I think you will enjoy this one.",__label__2
"Cute! Light reading but a lot of fun.: For those not familiar with black America this is a great introduction--especially into the whole hair issue. (You cannot understand a black woman if you don't understand black hair and all its issues). If you are already clued in, then this is a great little vignette on a set of topics that can loom quite large in the lives of many black American women--hair, skin colour, and the quest for a decent man.I enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in one sitting, way into the wee hours of the morning, because I couldn't put it down. I since lent it to my sister who got a message of self-empowerment out of it. She then lent it to a friend who loved it, and it is now in the hands of a friend of hers!That said, this is not capital L Literature, but it is fun.",__label__2
"Kept me glued.: Nappily Ever Afer was an outstanding book. I couldn't put the book down for two day's straight. Khandi reminded me of a lot of black women I know, beatiful but very insecure about them selves. I was very glad to see Venius found herself at the end. I couldn't understand for the love of me why a woman would want to force a man to marry her the way she did. I guess I learned a thing a two about the way women think when reading Venus' thoughts. This was a very intresting book, I'll be looking forward to reading the author's next novel.",__label__2

He is one of those verbal terrorists who continues to blame America and Israel for his own disastrous failures and the inability of the Arab and Muslim world to get past the 15th century. The chapters on America and Israel's Genocidal activities are filled with such ridiculous points that any 9 year old could refute them.If you would like to read a pathetic comedy, this is the right book. However, it is more of a waste of good trees. Mahmood is just another leftist professor who continues to criticize and abuse the hand that feeds him, America. He is no different than the troubled child who abuses his wonderful parents, and his silly book proves it.Irwin N. Graulich",__label__1
"Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: This book was a very poorly written effort in my opinion. Additionally, the author would have you believe that the terriorism that exists today is the fault of the U.S and the protestants that make the U.S. their home. It would seem that the author alines himself with Osama Bin Laden and those who wish to control the middle east. It's hard for me to imagine that this man is a professor at Columbia University. Instead of wasting his time here, he needs to return to his own country for the purpose of educating his own people.",__label__1
"Good idea, bad execution: This is the first book by Alastair Reynolds I have read. I must say I was disappointed. The idea behind the book is interesting. But Reynolds' writing is pedestrian at best. The pacing is terrible. The characterizations are thin. The book drags for hundreds of pages, then falls apart in the last 50. It seems like the editor got nervous at the length and told AR to wrap it up quick-smart.I would read other books by AR if they were given to me, but I won't be buying any others.",__label__1
"Absolutely AWESOME!: Usually I write a review only if I dislike something about a book. I rarely bother to write good reviews, because every book gets so many of them. In this case, however, I have to make an exception. For any fan of hard science fiction, ""Pushing Ice"" is AWESOME! It's got everything: realistic characters, solid physics and astronomy, believable near-future society (circa 2050), glimpses of far future society (circa 20,000 A.D.), some REALLY far future, aliens which are somewhat comprehensible, aliens which are completely beyond comprehension, rivalry, broken friendships, betrayal, marooning in space (on multiple levels), struggle for survival, etc. Even asteroid mining and that perennial ""stranded in space"" trick - using electric motors as generators :)",__label__2
"Boring Characters: I really enjoy the science in science fiction, and believable characters. I have watched the movie Aliens many times and I have always wondered why you would pick really stupid people to go into space. Is there going to be a shortage of smart people in the future? Are we going to rely on a bunch of idiots to take us into the far reaches of space? Is mister Renolds watching too many soap operas on TV?",__label__1
"Boring Ice: I usually enjoy the thrill of grand space operas. No suspense in this one though. Everything was totally predictable. The conflict between Svetlana and Bella was tedious; the aliens were somehow uninspired. I enjoyed a couple of his other books, but this one was far too long and uneventful.",__label__1

Read the first 1/3 of the book then pick up something else.",__label__1
"Enjoyable and mind-expanding: Enjoyable ride through time from modern ages to the far far future of the universe. The action starts out slowly enough as the crew begin their journey but it builds speed with a nice deliberate pace. The scope and depth of the book accelerate inevitably and irresistibly along with the central characters themselves. One of my favorite aspects of the book is that it is paced very much like climbing a mountain. Just when you reach what appears to be the peak, you realize there is even more to come, beyond what you had previously imagined.The physical description of the effects of close-to-light travel is also quite enjoyable and is one of the features one would expect from Reynolds, as a former scientist and a noted hard-sci-fi writer. I tend to have a soft spot for stories that follow human civilization through a rapidly accelerating future history, in particular those that explore technological singularity or singularity-like events, and this one satisfies.",__label__2
"Very impressive: This is the best scifi novel I have read for a while, goes above and beyond the author's revelation space series. It has real characters, good description of spaceflight in the next few decades, a mystery which really shocked me when revealed (didn't see that coming), plus big ideas and revalations about intelligent life in the universe. Everything fits together perfectly, highly recommended.",__label__2
"Space Opera it isn't...it's better than that: I've read Century Rain before this and thought that it was a rather average experience.Pushing Ice however had me absolutely hooked. Like other reviewers, I'll grant to have seen better character interaction elsewhere, but as alvays with good SF, it's really all about the setting and the plotline, and as a first encounter novel this ranks among the best.If you've enjoyed Peter Hamilton - the current master of Space Opera - but found him a bit long-winded and liked Arthur C. Clarke, but found him a bit too nerdy, you might give this one a try.It's been a while since I've had a reading experience that really made me loose myself to the story, but ""Pushing Ice"" did the trick. And then in one volume....IMO, there's too much crap in the space opera genre. Insofar this can be considered space opera - which I really don't think it is - this is definately a gold nugget.",__label__2
"By a true scientist!: An exciting science fiction novel that pushes the limits of scientific imagination. Mr. Reynolds has a Phd in Astronomy and worked for The European Space Agency for 13 years. Now, he is a full time science fiction writer. This novel explores behavior of humans when presented with arduous undertakings and reveals our darkest fears and how we try to cope with them in our unique way. In a science fiction frame, Reynolds tries to state that what is wired in us is not pure evil or pure goodness but a mix of them both. How much of each component you have in you will determine your course of actions and makes who you are. Because I'm a total geek, I loved it. Give it try and you might love it too. @shakirbahzad",__label__2
"Enjoyable Read: Best SciFi book I've read in some time. I'm hoping that Mr. Reynolds comes up with some sequels.As for those who have problems with the science: maybe you would be happier reading a textbook. I'm sure I'm not qualified to declare that this book is SciFI, Hard SciFI or just a work of fiction, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone willing to not grouse about the science.My only complaint is that it was not available on Kindle.",__label__2
"Turn on to this radio book.: A wonderful pictorial book about transistor radios, 175 of them, not only photographed but put in the context of fifties and sixties design.

I loved the chapter on design with its photos of grills and lettering, even a spread on 9-volt batteries.This is the kind of book that Chronicle do so well, interesting subjct, well designed and printed all for the general reader. If you collect these radios you will certainly want to have a copy but don't expect to get lots of technical detail or a price guide.

"Everything You Want From Dali and More: This book is the definitive look at Dali. I own a few other of his books but this one blows the out of the water. The only negative aspect about the book really comes down to my opinion. Some of my favorite paintings are fitted onto a page with 3 others making them a little difficult to see the extreme detail. While others get their own page but in my humble opinion didn't deserve it. While reading or just skimming through the paintings its awesome all the way through. The book is in chronological order so you can see his progress throughout his life. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't like Dali's style, there is so much in here that you'll find something. I've spent dozens of hours looking through it, finding something new each time.",__label__2
"excellent: in addition to providing many details about Dali's life, his relationship with Breton and the surrealists, his friendship with Picasso and so on, the book provides the reader with an excellent discussion/analysis/explanation of Dali's artistic/aesthetic choices and of his 'paranoiac-critical method'.This seems to be the definitive book on Dli's paintings.",__label__2

"Just ok...: I have had these for a little over a year now. The edges are starting to chip off, and they have been stained a little. They are ok, but not wonderful. I feel like for a Kitchen Aid product, they should be much better.",__label__1
"Compilation of ballads (with a great late night feel): This volume is a compilation of ballads taken from albums Joe Henderson recorded in the period 1992 to 1997. The music is supurb - Henderson almost whispers through his saxophone - and provides the perfect setting for a pleasant evening. Those who seek a late night CD look no further! Those who wish to explore Henderson's work of the nineties in more detail should consider buying (one of) the albums used for this compilation: ""Lush Life"", ""So Near, So Far"", ""Double Rainbow"", or ""Porgy & Bess"".",__label__2
Poor Quality: Just bought this toy for my son's birthday. The tower is very top heavy and won't stand up. They give you adhesive strips to stick to your wall/window. If the box wasn't torn by my son this would definetly be returned.,__label__1
"Cool, but not durable: My little brother just got this for his birthday. It's cool, but will probably be broken in a few days. The pieces that stick to the wall fall off alot. No action figures come with it either. And the bottom half is made of cardboard too--not cool.",__label__1
Frustrating: My son received this for his birthday and my normally laid back and quite handy husband was never so frustrated in his life putting a toy together. After the 3 or 4 hour labor of putting the thing together the toy would not work properly and my 3 year old son kept crying because he couldn't get the doors or elevators to work. Overall it was a terrible experience and we can't even get the thing back in the box to return it.,__label__1
Falls apart very easily: I bought this for my 6 year old son and it is very unstable. It falls apart way to easily. We have to lean it up against the wall so he can play with it and it still falls down.,__label__1
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY: My son is a HUGE bat man fan. This was a must last christmas.. well we never could get it to stand up right and then bat man wouldnt slide down with out him pushing him the rest of the way. It came apart no matter how easy he was with it. And he lost interest less than a week of tring to make it work. He still wants a bat cave so we bought the older version (that has great reviews)instead this christmas so hopefully this one will be the one to make him happy and my pocket book.,__label__1
Don't waste your money!: This was a real disappointment. It is incredibly flimsy and poorly made. Will never hold up to its intended play.,__label__1
Please Don't Buy this Toy: My son loves Batman and was looking forward to playing with this toy. My son is very bright and we could not figure out how to put this toy together properly. It kept falling apart and the directions were very confusing. Please do not waste your money. I wasted 45 dollars on a toy that I couldn't even put together!,__label__1
"Might be OK if your child is older: My 3 yr old son wanted this batcave SO BADLY. We got it for him and it was pretty frustrating. The parts kept falling off and the elevator has NEVER worked. For 2 days straight he played with it, broke every piece off practically, and came crying to mommy to every few minutes. That was 6 months ago. He pretty much hasn't played with it since. Too bad because he's such a batman freak.Maybe he was just too young for it. If you're buying it for a younger child...beware!",__label__1
"I've been had!: This is the only thing my son wanted for Christmas. I was hesitant because I thought it was a bit pricy. But I didn't want to disappoint my son so I bought it. True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly ""cool"" features another piece falls off. My son has a long attention span and can play with a toy for a half an hour before moving on to something else. This toy frustrates him after just a few minutes.",__label__1
"What a waste!: This toy is a disaster. Who ever heard of a toy that you had to tape to the wall to balance. Every time it moves, it falls over or falls apart. This is the last time I will ever buy this type of toy. The worst part is the look of disappointment on my son's face the first time he tried to play with this. You people should be ashamed, it's like stealing our money at our children's expense!!!",__label__1
"worst toy ever: I bought this toy for my 4 year old for Christmas and all you have to do is touch it and the pieces fall off. Durability is not even a consideration for this toy. I have never wasted my money on a worse toy than this. I really wanted the other bat cave listed but it is out of production...scary thing is that this is what they replaced it with. Do yourself a favor, don't waste the money I did!!!!",__label__1
"This toy is not worth the money: I sure wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this item! This is really the only toy my 6 yr old son asked for this Christmas! I couldn't believe how flimsy this toy is. There is no way he could even play with it. Everytime we tried to move it, it fell apart! I am very disappointed and do not recommend.",__label__1
"Fun if you can get it to stand up for any lenght of time: This again is Mattel proving to me that someone is not playing with the toys after they are made. Horrible construction, directions are a nightmare (no words at all and very hard to follow) and they put the flimsy paper piece on the bottom and the ""cave"" components on the top. This not only makes no sense (don't they know batman went down into the cave to get to the computers and all) but it makes the product very top heavy. They actually recommend you glue it to your walls. No toy should be sold that is 42 inches tall and have to be glued to the walls!! All they have to do at Mattel is hire someone with a young child or let a child play with a set and they would have seen it could have been switched around (heavy stuff on bottom) and it would work better. As my kid would say ""DUH""",__label__1
Batcave a good buy!: My boys got this for their birthday and I put it together the night before. It is quite large and impressive and my boys' friends found it their most impressive present. One friend thought it was the neatest toy he had ever seen. My sons actaually spent more time playing with their Justice League Watch Tower but this toy was next most popular. They already had all the Batman and sidekicks action figures to go with it so it worked out perfect. My sons still play with it every day. Well worth the money.,__label__2
"Catastrophe Cave!: The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy.",__label__1
"Great idea, poorly engineered: Where were the engineers for this toy, is what I'd like to know. What a great idea it is, but it just doesn't hold up to play. Now, I suppose if you're willing to bolt it into your basement wall, then it would hold up to some strong playtime. However, it is almost completely incapable of withstanding any play whatsoever without collapsing onto the floor. I highly recommend you read all the other reviews on this toy prior to purchase. Definitely needs to go back to the drawing board - ours went back to the store! What a disappointment!",__label__1
DO NOT BOTHER: This is toy so frustrating. Very hard to put together and even harder to get the working parts to work without the entire thing falling apart! My son loves batman and this was a gift from his Grammy so he is using it but I had to mount is to a special board to keep from falling into pieces and then tape it together! By next week it will find the dumpster. Waste of time and money and worse yet truly frustrating for my 5 year old..,__label__1
"Imagination at its BEST!: Yes, this item may be a little tippy. But find a way to attach it temporarily to a wall and it stays just fine. My son plays with this all the time! It is great! He pretends with his Batman, Superman, Spiderman toys and uses his imagination to capture the bad guys! It is a very cool toy and well worth the money.",__label__2
WORST TOY EVER!: After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. The cardboard background doesnt even fit in properly and my son has never touched it due to how unstable and flimsy it is. It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!,__label__1
"Fun, But Falls Apart: I bought this toy for my son's fourth birthday in September. I did not have problems putting the toy together and initially my son loved it. He and his friends played for hours and hours. The arms and ropes, etc. led to a lot of imaginative play. However, in my opinion the design is flawed and the quality of the toy, in general is very poor. The elevator never worked properly because, after awhile, the height of the toy causes it to sag one way or another and the elevator would get stuck. Also, the elevator was not big enough or offitted to hold the Batman figures, so when my son would put a figure in the elevator, it inevitably would fall over and jam the elevator. We've already thrown the toy out, a few months later.",__label__1
Batcave - get in touch with mattel: Like most of the other reviews here I bought the Batcave for my four year old and it was a disaster. I paid around 39 for it and see it's now retailing for 9. It just doesn't work. It's a pathetic toy. However I got in touch with Mattel and on the second attempt (they didn't respond first time or didn't get my e-mail) they phoned to offer me a choice of replacement toys. Hope everyone here has done this or will do it - complaining is the only way toy manufacturers will learn.,__label__1
"BATMAN TOYS NEEDS BETTER QUALITY: I think MATTEL needs to fire the team who makes all the Batman toys, & hire a team of people with quality & creativity in mind. This one of many Batman toys my 6 year old son has, every 5 minutes he comes to me to put the toy back together agian. (I glued together last years modle of the car, the 'wings' always fell off!) the cave is very top heavy, with a flimsy support & backing. If you don't have a permanent wall space to stick this toy on to it will fall as soon as you walk away! Plus there are three pices to this toy that would fall off as soon as I put on that we didn't need anyway.",__label__1
"Very Disappointed ...: Well - this was my son's #1 request from Santa Claus. Despite the reviews, he brought it to our house. As expected, it is quite flimsy. It is sad to watch my 5 yr old struggle with the elevator while trying to give batman a ride. It is so pathetic how these toy companies take advantage of children, and (their parents!) with such poor quality merchandise.",__label__1
Waste of money: Horrible toy for a my 4 year old son who is a batman fanatic... flimsy and not durable. Can not get the elevator to work properly always jams up. This toy won't last to long.,__label__1
"Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave: Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy.",__label__1
JUNK: MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER.,__label__1
Batcave Warning!!! Caution!!!: WARNING!!! CAUTION!!! Parents do not waste your hard earned money or valuable time with this toy. I am the proud father of two boys who were so excited to receive this batcave from Santa. Boy were they disappointed with the substandard quality. This has to be the worst display of a children's toy that I have seen in awhile. I feel that Mattel has stolen from me by misrepresenting this gypsy junk as an actual toy. Please do not purchase!,__label__1
"BAT GUANA!: This thing is a major piece of junk. It doesn't stick to the wall like it claims. You have to stand to play with it (cause all the cool stuff is at the top), and the extension pieces constantly fall off. I actually screwed it to the wall, but that lasted a whole 10 minutes as it wouldn't stay screwed into the wall. Then the scenery kept falling. Save your money and buy the cool batmobile or something.",__label__1
"Wrong Bruce, you idiots!: Bruce BANNER turns into THE HULK, not THE BATMAN, morons! It's BRUCE WAYNE who turns into Batman. Maybe this toy would get better reviews if product specialists spent a LITTLE more time researching the list of who transforms into whom.Hulk SMASH stupid Batcave!",__label__1
"Mattel + Batman = JUNK TOYS!: Just ""assembled"" the bat cave for my 5 year old. Pathetic construction and workmanship -- half of the gimmics don't work. Another pile of injection-molded plastic parts and stickers that I get to assemble -- what is this thing -- $4 of raw materials + $2 of shipping + $10 of marketing? Garbage. Shame on you Mattel, the only thing worse is the batman figures with the batarangs that take 30 minutes and a blowtorch to get out of the packaging. This batcave will collapse and die within hours of play, I'm sure of it. GARBAGE!",__label__1
"Fun For a Few Minutes, Until it needs fixing AGAIN!!: My son really wanted this toy and loves batman, so Grandma splurged on this expensive-for-what-you-get toy. First thing, it's a real bear to set up, and then when you do set it up it is really clumsy and pieces fall off very easily. The boys still had fun playing with it, even when the elevator constantly got jammed. They would have enjoyed it even more if they actually included at LEAST ONE character figure in the darn set. OOOPs, we did not notice until he opened the gift that the action figures used for the set were sold separately. All in all, don't waste your money.",__label__1
"a monumental waste of money: I bought this batcave for the grandson for Christmas because the older model was no longer available. I was leery about the height of the toy and the bad reviews, and with good reason. Every time I turn around, there's a piece of it that has to be put back on. And I didn't realize until I read the other reviews that there is an elevator. Ours has never worked. My grandson likes the toy, but is getting bored with it, since it's always falling apart and quite a few of the gadgets don't really work. Don't buy this toy!!",__label__1
"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing: We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart. I assume I will be super gluing it before long. I feel ripped off as a consumer. Buyer Beware!",__label__1
"Good Concept. VERY VERY Flimsy: I got this for my 5 year old. I loved the concept, unfortunatley I never seen such a flimsy toy. We had to super glue everything together because pieces would fall off, this is because there are no snaps to keep levels in place but rather just fits together. Would not buy this toy!!!!!!!!!!! Would not recommend this toy unless your willing to super glue all parts!",__label__1
"POOR QUALITY: I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!",__label__1
Don't Buy The Batcave: My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down.,__label__1
"Flimsy...not worth the effort!: Although, it doesn't break the bank, it is terribly disappointing. It barely stands by itself and is frustrating to both my sons, whereas all the pieces fall off or don't line up properly.",__label__1
"Save Your Money: I have previously purchased a Ross Berstein book (""Gopher Hockey by the Hockey Gopher"") and found that to be an entertaining read. Not so with this offeringAll Berstein seems to have done is find some of Herb's friends, turned on his tape recorder and then transcibe their comments, verbatim. The print is too small, the words and thoughts are redundant and the small paperback has the look and feel of a self-published work, which it is.The range of interviewees is tiny compared with the breadth of Brooks' life and all the interviews sound the same. There were a few pictures of young Herbie the player. Those are fairly interesting, but I found myself a little disappointed with this offering.",__label__1
"I wish it were a better book: In the book, author Bernstein notes that he writes 5 books a year. It shows. His books are poorly written: full of irritating grammar and spelling mistakes and lacking even the most basic story development.It's a shame Brooks wouldn't play the big NY publisher game--get an agent and find a talented ghost writer to work with on a memoir--or work with an established sports journalist on a well-researched, thoughtful biography. This book is just a collection of random thoughts from Brooks' friends and family. Many of them say interesting things, but without a persistent interviewer to ask the follow-up questions, few of the anecdotes yield much new insight.",__label__1

Many facts aren't fact, like the statement that Asda took over J Sainsbury's in 2003 - didn't happen.As the world's largest and most successful retailer there are many more interesting books about Wal-Mart. Fine if you're anti Wal-Mart or pro union.......but don't preach, make a book, let me decide!",__label__1
"Unacceptable: The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!",__label__1
"Keep looking if you want a portable mixer: I purchased this unit for its battery powered portable usage. It fails miserably as it produces so much hiss it is unusable. I mean it is poor with a captital P.The phantom power does not work when in battery mode, nor does the clipping LED's. Keep on looking if you want portability.",__label__1

"take a different class: After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money. After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous.",__label__1
Attempts at Classification: I'm not sold on social psychology. Part of my issue with this discipline is my personal fight to never let people pigeon-hole me and this seems to want to it on a grand scale.

This is a great failing because many people no very little about this topic.,__label__1

"Outstanding Book: From the persective of a U.S. Army Officer, I highly recommend this book. Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric",__label__2

After contacting the company many many times (btw - there customer service sucks! - No telephone number, unless u pay $2 per minute, just a computer-generated machine that unsuccessfully helps you called SARA). I finally put a claim in through the Better Busines Beaureau, there response was that they couldn't send me a new scanner cause it was after 1 year of my purchase, but they would be so kind enough as to let me purchase a new one and give me 25% off of their price (which was probably an elevated price). I told them to kiss off! Anyway - please don't buy this product or any Visioneer product - they Suck!",__label__1

There's no reason or excuse for Visioneer not to release an update.This was the last scanner I'll ever buy from Visioneer. How can I have any confidence that they won't do the same thing with their new scanners when I upgrade computers again?",__label__1

Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software.

Who cares about ths stinking singles charts? Who said good music had to be POPULAR? This is just a great LP. It has stood the test of time, and made it to CD.

"Fine for children, boring for adults: One has to be a young adult to enjoy this book. If you want to read about children in a foreign country without adult supervision, well, there you have it. I'm surprised it wasn't turned into a Disney movie.Definitely a children's book.",__label__1
"Does not work for Ipod connectivity on PC's: Bought this card to connect my dell 8100 to my ipod remixed. Installed the card in a snap without incident. Tried connecting my Ipod and it immediately started charging so I thought I was good. However, I opened itunes and nothing. Went to the iogear website thinking i needed to update the driver when I stumbled across the statement on the Tech Support Library, document #10162:""Why won't my IPod work with the GUF320?Both the IPod and mini-IPod require a Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL) certified card to connect to the computer. At this time, the GUF320 is not WHQL certified.We apologize for any inconvenience.""Well that would have been nice to know before I ordered the card and wasted my time and effort.",__label__1
"USB ports won't work with iPod: Bought this card to use with an iPod, and was greatly disappointed. My new iPod only comes with a cable to connect to USB 2.0 ports, and the USB ports on this card DO NOT WORK with iPods. I had to go buy an additional cable (iPod to Firewire) in order to get my iPod working. The Firewire ports on this card DO work with an iPod, but you'll need a Firewire cable that new iPods may not give you.",__label__1
"Plug and Go Go Go!!: No fuss, no muss. Just plug it in the PCI slot and reboot. Windows XP installed it automatically and I was up and running.It could not have been easier unless someone else did it for me....",__label__2
Not G5 Compatible: Though the description states this card will work with G3 and above it wont even fit in the PCI slot for a G5 1.8 Single or a1.8 Dual I belive its because those slots are PCI-X. I am going to try the Sonnet alegro which says it will work with a G5 also. We'll see.The Sonnet alegro works!,__label__1
Bad quality: Installation and use was easy and good. But the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between.,__label__1
"good value, works like a charm!: This card installed without a hitch on my Dell Dimension with Windows XP Pro (Service Pack 2). It wasn't even necessary to install any drivers; Windows simply detected the new FireWire and USB devices and installed them without prompting.The device works great. I noticed a huge increase in transfer speeds coming off my USB 2.0 capable digital camera (my Dell came stocked with USB 1.1 only).I would definitely recommend this PCI card!",__label__2

Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card. The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update: Over 3 weeks and I'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update: Finally got the warranty replacement.

"Rockin' In Rhythm...: I listened to the first track, Rockin' In Rhythm five or six times before going onto the second track; and experienced the delight of discovering something truly good and remarkable from two artists, about whom I thought I knew everything good and remarkable. Back in the 1970's I collected Ella songbooks on vinyl (Gershwin, Porter, Rogers & Hart), but never got around to the Ellington collection. How fortunate that I inadvertently saved this little gem for a rainy day. Listening to it is like discovering Ellington and Ella anew. Except with the added appreciation of a fan. I would never tire of Rockin' In Rhythm, so reliable a source of joy it is...my soul smiles for the privilege to witness this collaboration.",__label__2
Not Enough Choices: There are not enough color selections for the average person. The product seems to work but Coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones.,__label__1
"not immoral: this book is surely one of the best. its meaning is crystal clear : in life better strong than weak. the fact is that the king doesn't steal food or money like those weak officers , he just buys low ans sells high. what clavell wants to say to us is that making money out of other people's stupidity is much better than being stupid.",__label__2
"Truly and excellent book.: Actually, I rate this an 11. This was the first, and the fifth, and the last Clavell novel that I have read (yes, I read it three times). Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest. Not for the light hearted, but a must for anyone interested in WWII or in Asia.",__label__2
"A wonderful tale!: This is a magnificent book. It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely places. I disagree with the reviewer who thinks it is a depressing book - it is a novel of the human spirit, with a dash of good old capitalism thrown in for good measure.Again, it is a wonderful book. It will stay with you for a long time.",__label__2
"Not for those looking for an uplifting read.: I'll be honest, this is a depressing book. But it is about a depressing subject. This is a semi-autobiographical look at the author's internment in one of the Japanese's POW camps, Changi. It is a statement on the ingenuity and cunning of mankind, but also of its brutality. If you're looking for a quick, solid read, this is it.",__label__2
Much more action oriented than other Clavell work.: Great! Reminded me of The great escape only without the escape. Very moving.,__label__2
"Clavell has done it again. His style expands into the 1900s: This is another fabulous work by James Clavell, a stand-out in his collection. Even though the book was set in a prison camp, all I thought about was that I wanted to be 'The King'. A rivetting story of life and death, friendship and betrayal. Shorter than his other works, but equally valuable.",__label__2
"A significant change from Noble House Saga: A very good read, this novel is more ""complex"" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering ""what the point was the novel trying to get across?"" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it.",__label__2
"Not all that profound after all: I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the ""moral dilemmas"" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a ""moral dilemma"" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously.",__label__1
"Disapointing: After Shogun one would expect much better. Compared with Shogun, King Rat is rather 2D. The plot is not as engrossing. I think readers will have a difficult time getting into the story. The ending is somewhat predictable (what do YOU think happens to all the prisoners?)and there are many things that are never explained (who is the informant that knew about the radio? ). On the whole an entertaining book, but it moves slowly and doesnt go anywhere (how exciting can life in a prison be anyway? :P )",__label__1
"Reads like a book for 8 to 12 year olds: I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying ""The Brothers Karamazov"". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?",__label__1
"Couldn't get into it.: I'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I found it really slow. I read the paperback version, and to be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish the book. Major disappointment.",__label__1
king rat: the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl,__label__1
"A great study of the human psyche: Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the reader with his insight to the human condition. From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along.",__label__2
"An unforgettable journey!: In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart.",__label__2
"Great Book and Series: Great Book and Series. This was the 3rd time through the Series. Just wish they had the Last and Final book in the Series which was ""Whirlwind"" when I was ready for it.",__label__2
"Great book if you are into WWII history of the Pacific: After living in Singapore for seven years, I read a lot on the war in the pacific.This is one of my favorites. Though fictional, it captured what I saw and read about the Japanese occupation.Clavel is the one of the best.",__label__2
"Outstanding!: If the human condition under extraordinary circumstances interests you, then this book is a must. It's kind of a non-sequitur in the context of the whole Asian saga, but I found it to be absolutely captivating, and a couple of the main characters make a later appearance in Noble House.",__label__2
"Really liked the book: When I first read the book a lot of years ago, i loved it and thought it should have been made in to a movie It's been at least 30 years since I first read it. I enjoyed it so much",__label__2
"Disappointing: This is the 4th Clavell book I've read, I was more than a little disappointed. I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it. Although a lot was made of their inner feelings, this made me feel that they were both just shallow people.",__label__1
"below par: after reading all of clavell's books, i was looking forward to King Rat. It made me uneasy. I was left with a very disatisfied feeling. Who rated this book so high? were they relatives?I do not recommend it.",__label__1
"Quick, interesting, and accurate: This is different from the ""Asian Saga"" books. Still, it is just as excellent. Moreover, it is short and to the point. Clavell was in a POW camp so I get the sense that it is accurate, that it lauds real people through their character portrayals (indirectly), and it scathes other people in the same way.",__label__2
Numbers Peg puzzle: This number peg puzzle is not for a 2 year old! You cannot tell the nine from the six and depending on your child's age he/she might be confused with the colors of the pegs to the colors on the background.,__label__1
My son loves it!: My son learned his numbers so quickly with the help of this puzzle. He loves all of the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles and I figured this would be great to help him learn his numbers. I was right! Great present! Highly recommended!,__label__2
Great buy!: You cant go wrong with these puzzles! My son loves to play with them and discover whats under the puzzle pieces. It helps a child develop number recognition which is so important. Very well made and durable! SOmething I will surely save for the next generation.,__label__2
"Colorful, durable AND educational!: I bought this for my great nephew - 18 months old who is already learning to count and learn his colors. I also got him a dino puzzle by Melissa & Doug. Both items are really great. They are very durable and colorful so he likes playing with them and putting the shapes back in their places. The number puzzle is fun because when you take the number out, there are pictures under each number for example - take out the three - there are three turtles (I may have the wrong animal but you get the gist!!). His 3 year old cousin that visits often also loves playing with them so they have a good age range.",__label__2
cute: My 2 year old daughter really enjoys this puzzle. Perfect for learning numbers and counting. I would recommend for anyone with a toddler. Not so much for babies as I have found they end up chewing a ruining the pieces...,__label__2
"Best ""Toy"" Ever!: My 16 month old has been playing with this off and on for about a month, and she can now put every single number in the correct place every time without a second of hesitation! Because the numbers are written below each space, she now even recognizes the WORD for each number! Am I ordering the alphabet puzzle immediately.",__label__2
"Numbers Puzzle: I bought this puzzle for my son because we can't afford day care prices and need some things to work with him at home on the basics like ABC's, Numbers, Colors and Shapes. I have nearly every educational puzzle that Melissa and Doug have put out and I love them all.",__label__2
I love these puzzles.: My almost 2yr old learned her numbers with this puzzle. It's wonderful and easy for little fingers. This is definately not a cheaply made puzzle.,__label__2
"Not appropriate for 16 month old - see update: The pegs and the pictures do not match at all. So, the child has to count the objects in the space of the number and then find the corresponding number. Notice in the picture that they are not even the same color. So if your child does not recognize numbers yet then this puzzle will not work. I know the manufacturer recommends 24 month age but my son is doing other 24 month puzzles already. I'm sure it will be challenging in a few months as he approaches 2 years of age and/or he learns to count. The 6 and the 9 are similar but not interchangeble.update: I stand corrected! My almost 18 month is doing this puzzle and loves it. I do not give enough credit to the clever little brains. He can see the shape and match the shape to the puzzle piece. Amazing. They just seemed so similar to me but I was wrong. 5 star puzzle. . . .",__label__2
"GREAT NUMBER BOARD: Our son plays with this board while I'm feeding him. He's only 20 months, but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him. It's well built. Arrived in only a couple days. Our son loves it!!",__label__2
Not water resistant -- one spill ruined the look: 1. The 6 and 9 pieces are interchangeable...that led to some confusion.2. I want this same puzzle with no glossy paper glued on. The remains of a drink were spilled onto it and the paper is now peeling off and it also absorbed the stainThe whole reason I buy wooden toys is for durability -- this same toy with just a stained/painted/plain wood would be perfect,__label__1
"Excellent for my students: I teach mentally handicapped adults at a local community college, and if you want durable puzzles that your students can use over and over again, I strongly recommend getting puzzles like this.

"A waste of time: This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs.",__label__1
"Amazon needs to sort out Weinstock and Huneker: This book is listed with Weinstock as the author, but Huneker is the author. Weinstock wrote the forward. He also wrote a book called ""Chopin: The Man And His Music"". Weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author.",__label__1

The best thing about it? NOT boring. I'm so sick of the innocuous, adjectival, over-written, meaningless poems in so many journals and ""literary"" magazines of our time. David Trinidad is smart--read for pure pleasure, and then read again and look for the subtle tricks and talent he employs to make these poems truly great art! Truly fresh, too. No one else is writing about our tarnished culture like Trinidad. He is truly unique, and like I said, the best compliment I can give is that this book is not a bore--something that 98% of all books of poetry these days are! Thank you Mr. Trinidad! You've got me reading and enjoying poetry again!",__label__2

"Best introduction to its subject that I know of: When one is trying to get a basic overall grasp of Greek mythology, it can be an overwhelming and formidable subject, and one can be at a loss for the best place to start. Most books I've found either give too much detail too fast or else are hit-and-miss selections that don't give a very comprehensive introduction. If that's been your experience too, this book could be an excellent solution to your problem. It gives a highly readable thorough introduction without overwhelming you with details. As an introduction to or review of Greek mythology, it is therefore highly recommendable. Although probably aimed primarily at children, I suppose grown-ups too, if not already expert on the subject, won't find it too elementary.",__label__2
"A great book~: This book has great myths. At first, it seems boring, but soon your eyes will be glued onto the pages. It is a wonderful book to share around to your classmates and teachers. Each story has a morel that teaches you well on a situation. I recommend this to people around the teens.",__label__2
"Informational: This book is a great resource book. Not only for young readers but for anyone who want to know the most significant stories in Greek Mythology. This book makes a good basic reference for any history class. Anyone can learn easily from this book because it is easy to read, yet you receive a lot of information. It also includes colorful illustrations that giulds the reader through.This book includes sections such as: ""Mother Earth and Her Children"", ""The Gods and Foddesses of Mount Olypus"", ""Zuez and the Creation of Mankind"", and ""Triumnphs of the Gods"". It has such stories as: Prometheus and His Gift to Man, Pandora, Echo, Medusa, Jason, Odysseus, and much more.A personal favorite of mine is the story of Jason. One man fell for the love of a youthful princess, and tempted to leave his wife, Medea. Medea spent much of her money and prepared a feast for Jason. The revenge was sweet.... I can't tell you the rest. Buy this book, its far too interesting.",__label__2
"Great book - a good introduction to Greek mythology: I purchased this book for my 9 year old son as a companion book to several astronomy and constellation guides he requested for his birthday. He completely devoured it in three days - the illustrations are bold and the stories are dramatic/gruesome enough to capture his interest (without being too horrible or nightmare-inducing). We are finding that knowing a bit about the legends behind the constellations makes stargazing that much more enjoyable. I would recommend this book for boys and girls 8-10 years old, although I admit I enjoyed reading it, too!",__label__2

"Incorrect and Misleading: Attention! Sheldon's views of Jefferson's thought to not reflect on Jefferson's! I could not believe what I was reading when I opened up this book. I hought that Sheldon had at least a relatively firm grasp on Jefferson's thought after reading his book ""The Political Philosophy of Thomas Jefferson,"" I was sorely disappointed. It appears that Sheldon may understand what he thought, but is not able to translate it to the events of today. It is a shame that Sheldon failed in his effort, because such a work as this, properly done, would be wonderful to see. If you truly interested in what Jefferson would think about current events today, let me sum it up for you. He would be outraged and saddened to see what happened to the once great nation that he helped to found. He would be enraged at the tyrannical activities of our government. As for his political leanings, he would most certainly be a radical libertarian.",__label__1

If you are in the middle of a scan job, say you are on the 30th page already, and something is wrong, there is no recovery feature so you have to start from scratch. In fact, tech support says you will get constant errors if you scan more than 20 pages at a time, yet the document feeder is supposed to hold 50 pages (?). You can scan and then merge multiple scans to become one, but that is not the point. The point is that out of 900 pages of scanning, i got about two dozen errors which requires me to shut off the machine, close the scanning program and start all over again. I returned the product and got another documate 510 because tech support said it must be faulty, but the second is exactly the same. This scanner is nothing but a pain in the rear. I am shipping the second one back in the morning.",__label__1
"ALL images are titled left: I have tried several permutations and combinations with this scanner. Here are some of the observations:1) Image resolution is too bad for the file size it produces. I used an EPSON scanner before, and could get a much better B&W; and color resolutions for a much shorter file size2) All the images are titled towards one side. So, if you are scanning photographs, this is not the right scanner. A part of the picture will always need to be cut out if you try to straighten it up!3) When trying to get a reasonable B&W; resolution (300 dpi), scan speed is not as great as advertised.Overall, I don't think this scanner is worth its price.",__label__1
"JUNK - don't waste your money or time!: My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!",__label__1
"worked well, but now driver issues: This scanner worked fine for me for a year, and now with later windows 2000 service patches, it has what appears to be USB problems. I've tried the latest driver available on several machines, and if they have windows 2000 with the newest patches, it will only work once or twice, then there is a driver error. I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling, rebooting, trying different USB ports, etc. but short of re-imaging the machine, it won't recover. I am using this scanner with Adobe Acrobat 6 Pro with the latest service patches. I've researched and not found a new driver for this device for quite some time. Going to try to hack on a visioneer driver after reading some of the other reviews here.",__label__1
"Not great, but not bad: Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. The program is confusing and terribly disorganized. I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one. It has been quite an experience, causing me to use Kinko's and similar because I couldn't get this scanner to work. Since using Acrobat, most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level.",__label__1
"Good scanner - poor software: Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow.",__label__1
Stinks jams all the time: Jams with 2 pages jams with 10 pages. I basically have to sit here and babysit the scanner the whole time. I could scan my documents faster one page at a time on a regular scanner. Returning it as we speak.,__label__1
"Compatible ONLY with their software: Bad Scanner. Only with their software are you able to scan in paperwork. Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of. If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed, you can't use Acrobat to scan in software. Stay away from the Documate line of scanners!",__label__1
"worst scanner ever: I bought this scanner to scan approximately 100,000 pages of literature and it is just horrible. I returned it after a few weeks and got the fujitsu scansnap scanner.

"Get This Player!: Before I decided to get this player, I did my research. I looked up the ipod, the dell jukebox, and the samsung napster player. I chose this one because from what I read, it was the best deal for the money. Another reason I got it is because you can put WMA files on it. That takes up half the space of MP3's. That's important because I have a lot of music. The software is great. you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories. transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy. even the battery life is great- it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good. only 1 problem, no accessories...yet. I hope it's because it's new and they are not out yet, but being without a remote is hard. They player's interface itself is also very easy to use. can't complain and I recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon. GET IT, IT'S WOTH EVERY PENNY!!",__label__2
"Not as advertised: My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No.",__label__1
"Good for a little while, but....: Sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod. But with a low price, comes lower quality. Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, ""If the product seems broken, we cannot help,"" or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod. If you really need to save, buy this thing on Amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund. I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player, and I'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out.",__label__1
"**Great player, but but for newbies**: I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies. But if you want great control and organization over your MP3s, this is definitely the player for you!!!",__label__2
"Zen: I have been using my zen xtra for 3 months now and i am very pleased with it. I can drag and drop songs with the nomad explorer. I can listen to it for 15hrs at a time before it needs a recharge and it holds my whole collection of cds.There are however a few cons to this product.The plastic clip that comes on the carring case snaped so I replaced it with a nylon strap I sewed onto the back of the case and havn't had a problem since.There are two things that could really improve this product, a line out and a fm transmiter to use to play in cars that have only a cd player.This is an awsome mp3 player and well worth the money.",__label__2
"Good Unit: I've already dropped it, (unit was off) and it's fine. It's a little larger than I expected, so is more of a pocket unit than an armband or clip-on. The creative software is not too good - I did some searching and found some recommendations for Notmad Explorer - which does truly rock as accessory software for the Nomad. It will copy over playlists from most other media players without a hitch- which was problematic with the Creative application. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.",__label__2
"First and Last: This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again. As others have mentioned the headphone jack breaks quite easily, but not from rough use, it just breaks down. I barely had this thing a month before it started giving problems, and I only used it to go from home to work. This I guess is why people flock to the Ipod, cause you may not be able to replace the battery but it is damn sturdy. This is just a piece of junk",__label__1
"lacking file format support is not for me: this player supports ONLY mp3 and wmaunfortunately, my own-made music format is ogg, and downloaded radio recording is asf format, this player don't support bothand lack of digital recording is a major drawback too, unlike iriver, it has digital in and out, this is a necessary for mesorry, zen, this is not for me",__label__1
"What's with the low sound?: I bought the Zen Xtra 40Gb yesterday, taking it back today. The sound is awful. The volume range goes up to a 25, and even with the EAX or whatever it's called on, it's barely audible. I don't know if it's the jack gone like you all say or if this is just designed for easy listening. No good for loud music. Prepare to listen to background noise, not your music. This thing sucks. Don't buy it.",__label__1
"BASIC DESIGN FLAW: Forget how this unit works because it has a basic design flaw that will drive users crazy! The front cover has a release button that allows removal of the front cover to access the removable battery. Forget about the release button. You don't need it. just tap the lower left hand corner of the case and the cover pops open! Convenient, huh? No way! This design flaw is a total pain in the ass! And it's not just my unit. I tested two other new, out of the box units and both did the same thing. Simply bad design and no quality testing. Do yourself a favor and avoid this unit at all costs unless you don't mind continually closing the case after it has popped open on it's own.",__label__1
"Headphone Jack Problems: The headphone jack on my Zen Xtra stopped working day 40 (1st day on a 7-day cruise, no less!) While Creative did replace the unit, why haven't they recalled all Zen's?This is my second Nomad -- I had a Nomad 2.0 20GB, but it's screen stopped working. Creative refused to repair unless I paid $105, so (silly me) I bought a new unit instead.Never again, Creative!",__label__1
"A Possible Discontinued Item?: What's going on Creative Labs? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is ""sold out"" or more likely ""discontinued"" at the almighty Amazon.com? hmmmmm....",__label__1
Great MP3 player: Where to start I have had this for 10 years and it is still ticking that alone is a tesament to how well the thing works. Over that ten years It has traveled with me to over a third of the world. This is to include half a tour in Iraq. It has been dropped and has been trough airport security more times than most people. Because of this I have never had a reason to buy an Ipod. And to be honest for music I would rather use this. Only reason that I own anything like an Ipod is that its my Iphone. So I think that the Xtra is by far the one of the best mp3 player made.,__label__2
"Headphone jack: I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas. So, I've had it for a month, and the headphone jack went out. I called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty. It'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it. Nothing but hassle with this company. What kind of product goes out within a month?",__label__1
"Steer clear of all Creative MP3 players: I love my Zen Xtra 40GB - well at least I loved my Xtra. The player is great, except for one major detail - the shoddy quality of the headphone jack. IT WILL FAIL! If you get lucky it will still be under warranty. If you aren't expect to pay at least $40 for the clowns at Creative to fix it. If you think I am just flaming them, check out their forums.",__label__1
"Solid Player without the ""iPod Mystique"": I purchased this player over 4 months ago. I read all of the reviews and I was aware of the pros and cons going in. This player is slightly thicker than the same capacity ipod. On the upside, the battery is user upgradeable, which iPod users can't do. The main downside to this player is the software. I highly recommend NotMad Explorer from http://www.redchairsoftware.com as a replacement for the poor Creative software. The upsides are great sound quality, great capacity, decent battery life and a good price. If you don't care about looking trendy carrying an iPod, take a good hard look at the Creative Nomad Zen players.",__label__2
"Doing the job for less money!!!!: If you want space to carry your music everywhere...this is your device. For all those reviews about the cover, now the cover included with the player has window to the screen, no need to take the player out of the case, unless you are changing the battery. A USB cable is included...no extra purchase. And the fact that you can copy the music back to your computer is a plus for me. The buttons takes a little getting use to it, but for almost $200 less, I can deal with it. The software is easy to learn, and the fact that you can replace the battery with ease...big plus...",__label__2
"Not a fan: I took my zen back after a week of problems.It's really fussy about id3 tags, which is a problem if some of you collection didn't come _directly_ off cd. I fiddled around with various automated taggers, but never got things working to satisfaction. The player crashes every 3 to 8 hours of operation and frequently takes 20+ minutes rebuilding it's database of tracks after a crash (i hear this process is made long by incomplete id3 tags).Two days ago the left headphone channel started cutting out, as it has for many other reviewers. That was the last straw. I'm over it, thinking about a rio Karma or nothing at all.",__label__1
"THIS PLAYER IS TRASH !: The price looks good do not be fooled.Mine also worked ok for the first 6 months reguardless that the software would not transfer a portion of my music. The death of this unit was when I had fixed the ID3 tages to get all my music to be able to be tranfered to the player , I removed the music library and then reloaded the repaired lib at this point the player will not play anything corectly. parts of tracks play and parts are garbled.This is true when playing over headphone jack usb to pc will still play normal. This is not the same problem as the phone jack breaking like happens to 2/3 of the players.",__label__1
Phone Jack Faulty: I loved this thing until 2 1/2 months after purchase... The phone jack is not working properly. Now I am very disappointed. Glad I got a 2 year replacement plan from Best Buy.

"Good for the price: I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. The Pros:Price! Almost half what an ipod would cost you! I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization. Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks. It's horrible. redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more! The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day.",__label__2
"What a great toy!: I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. I decided to purchase this one based on its reviews and cost. I'm not sorry. The only thing I had challenges with was transferring music from my PC and CD's to the player. I searched and searched and finally figured it out. I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it. It isn't much larger/heavier than an IPOD and is very versatile (not to mention a whole lot less expansive). I also like the fact that it's a ""mini"" external hard drive so I can store large files on it if necessary.",__label__2

So, from that aspect, it is very nice. now every positive normally comes with a few negatives. as you may guess, due to the size of this unit, the receiver is probably not the most powerful or accurate receiver, so you need to learn how to cope with these aspects of it. I have had cases where the receiver got confused when I was in the city (San Francisco) with a couple of tall buildings around or when I was driving around on windy roads in Sierra.

The book doesn't cover important aspects such as selective harvesting (how to keep damage on fish as low as possible so it can be released again) or treatment of fish, once it's caught (swift killing, keeping, cleaning).Two thirds of the book are about baiting, with major chaptors on how to use life bait such as small fish, salamander, frogs. However, the author completely fails to address ethical concerns about this technique(""replace your bait frequently. When a frog tires and stops kicking, it is much less effective""), a technique that is actually forbidden in some countries because of the cruelty involved.",__label__1

"pretty good documentary: overall, the documentary was pretty cool. however, about 99% of the beach boys clips were from a prior documentary, an american family from '85. they should have included the clip of dennis singing manson's song never learnt not to love (aka cease to exist). especially since the title of the movie is the beach boys & the satan. but did have cool footage of interviews with dick dale and dean torrence and the chantays. also kim fowley was cool too.",__label__2
beach boys and the satan: a totally off and enjoyable movie. All Brian Wilson fans should see this movie.,__label__2
Great Group: This is one dvd that any beach boys fan should have in their dvd collection.And if you ever wonder how such an clean cut band got ever involed in the likes of Charles Manson again this the dvd for you or if you like the beach boys music again get this dvd cause it everything that you want to know.So buy your copy now and enjoy.Rondall Banks,__label__2
"What a piece of junk!: Recently, I went and bought this CD Player, i was going to geta ... Sony one but ended up with this one instead cuz' it was cheap u know? Well, this one I bought didn't even have antiskip protection at all! It skips whenever I go and it eat batteries like crazy! I had wasted over 10 batteries within a month. What a piece of junk! I don't think this product differs either so I recommend not buying it and get a better product. In fact, I just going to get a new CD Player from KOSS which I think will be better. This is not worth your time, and the cd players ugly too!",__label__1
"DON'T BUY THIS ONE!: I purchased this product just a few months ago and it's broken already. It was used at a desk with ear phones so it wasn't moved,bounced or anything you would expect a personal player to withstand.It skipped at the slightest bump and went through batteries like crazy.I now have a different CD player and would not recommend this to anyone.",__label__1
Okay: This is an okay player. I never had skipping problems. The music played pretty good. I rate it okay.,__label__2
"Not so great: This is NOT Koss at its best. I recently bought its newest model and trashed this one. Don't bother buying it, a good price-bad deal! Buy the new one!Recommended Manufactors: Koss Aiwa Sony",__label__1

"this game has it all: though the series nba street never seems to change, the game it self is real fun. it comes packed with features such as just a regular game of street ball. There is also a story mode which you also unlock stages for the regular game of street ball. you can create your own character and choose his stats too. something strange, not in a bad way, but you can do tricks like handstands and more. there are many teams and players to choose from such as kobe bryant. this includes mini-games such as arcade shootout and shot blocker. It also has a really cool music track variety and a sports announcer too. It really is a good game and it will keep you entertained for hours. Its an A++++++++++++ i RECOMMEND THIS!",__label__2
"Great Graphics But NO GAMEPLAY and BAD CONTROLING: When I read these review I thought this game was going to be amazing but no one mentioned that this game has very bad Controling. Here is some on the problems. When you go up for a shot and press the ""o"" button the player goes up and once you let go it takes about half a second for the player to let go of the ball so you really have no SHOT CONTROL. This game is not like many other basketball games where once your let go of the button it shoots. This game has been with me for about 2 weeks and I stopped playing this game on the first day because it got very lame and boaring because you dont have alot of control over your players.There are a few other problems in this game. The players really dont look like the actuall players and do not play like them eather. I would highely reccomend you not to get this game and would suggest ""NBA"" or another great sports game like ""FIFA"".",__label__1
"Not worth your money: They should have called this product lemon vaseline. The scent is nice, but it almost isn't a scrub at all; it's got some granulated sugar among a sea of greasy pommade.

"Not very good quality, hard-to-see markings: This fan heater can oscillate, which is controlled by the foot switch (i.e., the foot switch doesn't turn the heater on or off). You can tilt the heater, too, but not by much. Overall, the heater feels cheaply made and soemtimes it doesn't work; I have to unplug and replug it to make it go again.The markings for the two knobs (left for power/fan level, right for thermostat) are *very* hard to see; they are almost non-existent. This is a very stupid design decision.I wouldn't buy this heater again despite its low price and good safety features.",__label__1
"Value is the issue here: Yes, this isn't the best space heater I have ever owned, but it has a unique shape where it doesn't gather a bunch of dust, like past heaters have, and you can't beat the price for its performance.",__label__2
"THIS THING SUCKS: Not only is the heat (btu)rating false, (in my oppinion), but to me it doesnt put out heat at all (relivently speeking) the tip over feature has prevented the unit from opperating several times in the 3 hours since i recieved it.. furthermore.. i will never purchace a heater made of plastic.. think about it.. plastic melts and metal doesnt (at the advertised tempurature) the fan speed i would equate to a gentle breeze if that. the heat output is far, far, below what i would have expected based on the advertisement.. basically in my oppinion this product is worthless to purchase unless you are trying to heat a refrogerator box sized space 5 degrese in a 70 degree enviroment.. look elsewhere for your heating needs.",__label__1

A very simple view of a complex subject: Reaching for the Light takes a very simple approach to a complex subject. Emilie Rose certainly researched ritual abuse well for having known about her own abuse for only one year prior to writing this book. In my opinion it takes years of therapy and intensive work to fully understand the damage done and the path to healing for the deep problems within. Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage. My advice is to skip this book.,__label__1
"The Facts/The Fiction: I'm sorry, but I have seen such overwhelming evidence to support the fact that almost all ""ritual abuse"" cases WERE indeed caused by mass hysteria and community pressure. So many individuals in these communities were forced not to appear ""weak,"" and jumped on the neighborhood bandwagon to accuse, accuse, accuse.Nothing is more horrifying than the thought of our children being in peril...but that fear sadly caused a lot of irreversible damage to many innocent people's lives in these cases.From the Salem Witch trials to the Senator McCarthy insanity to this mess, it seems that every so often the civilized world goes mad. We can learn from it...but not by reading this wrongheaded book.",__label__1
"I'm sorry, but...: ...I've seen too much damage come out of the trumped-up ritual abuse hysteria of the '80s/'90s. Thank God (yes, I'm a Christian), that this mostly-imagined phenomenon is no longer ""happening."" This book, while well-intentioned, is not based in reality.",__label__1
"A work of fiction: It is extremely important to realize that essentially all evidence of Satanic Ritual Abuse (SRA) comes from memories created during Recovered Memory Therapy (RMT). RMT has been shown to generate mostly false images: images that feel like real memories, but which are of events that never happened. It is also important to realize that Multiple Personality Disorder has now been rejected by almost all therapists. This book feeds into the victim culture of the 1980s and 1990s. It is thus dangerous to victims of recovered memory therapy and will probably delay their recovery. There are many books available that contain a realistic assessment of ritual abuse: K. Letcham & E. Loftus, ""The Myth of Repressed Memory.""R. Ofshe & E. Watters, ""Making Monsters.""M. Pendergrast, ""Victims of Memory.""",__label__1

I found myself turning the pages feeling the authors pain, joy and sadness.This is a unique style of writing, and maybe it would have worked well for a novel, but the author told it the way he felt it, and the poetry works in conveying what he wanted to say! I recommend it to anyone that has been in a similiar situation and hope that it can help then understand what they have been through, and maybe help them resolve their past.The only down side to the book is that I would have liked to read more. There are only 97 pages of actual poetry, and the author's own words, which I found to be very profound. Maybe the author's next book will be longer. I look forward to reading more of his work.",__label__2

(for grammar section buy Cliff's or Longman)2)The problems in the book are less difficult than those on a real exam.3)The problems in the book were arranged in very boring manner.4)The CD-Rom is only for Listening. (for more computer practice buy Delta's Key for Toefl Test with CD, which has 10 tests or Cambridge Preparation for Toefl Test, which has 7 tests. Both books have CD-Rom simulated CBT.)5) The Essay section is fair. (for the best essay section buy Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test)Generally, there is no one book for the preparation for the TOEFL. Most likely you will need some combination of them.For instance,a) Delta for practice and reading. Moreover, you may wish to buy just Delta CD Rom without book and cassets for practice only;b)Cliff's or Longman for grammar;c)Cambridge for essay and for practice.Good luck!",__label__1
"Good examples and helpful hints: I bought this book after i failed to get the score i needed in the TOEFL exam, and it helped me a lot at the second time I did the test. The best part about it is the CD-ROM that has 4 complete tests so you can practice just like if you were doing the real Computer Based TOEFL Test. It helps you to get in the mood of the test so you are prepared when you take the real test. There is only one thing that should be enhanced in this book. The review and hints at the ""writing test part"" are not enough. There should be more essay examples. Over all, this is the book you have to buy if you are planning to pay just for one book to prepare for the TOEFL",__label__2

"This is a perfect review book, but it is not a textbook.: If you know English well and you need only to review some important details, this is the book you need to buy. It covers small rules, which are VERY IMPORTANT for the TOEFL, but it does not tell you much, for example, about sequence of tenses.In other words, this book will help you to improve your score, but it can not teach you English if you are a beginner.For me, the most important part of the book was structur review. IT really helped! Listening part shows the same level of difficulty as in the TOEFL, but reading is much easier then on the test. To understand the reading level of difficulty and to practise the test I would recommend TOEFL Test Preparation Kit.",__label__2

"Humor about males being incompetent in the birth process: In general, I have little appreciation for humor based on male parental incompetence. Furthermore, ... I have just as little time for humor based on female mechanical incompetence. The theme of this book is male incompetence when it comes to pregnancy and birth.

If you have ever wondered what they really wore, and why they wore it then I would suggest that you look to these books for the answers. Typically these books have a full year bound together. Each month should have a color fashion plate featuring the current wardrobe fashions. They also have music, poems, short stories, knitting and crochet patterns, health tips and cooking hints. They provide a valuable insight into the era. If you are a civil war reenactor there is no better source for accurate information, and if you are just a fan of American history, these books are an outstanding source.",__label__2

"An enormous disappointment: As a fan of both Costello and Frisell, I was pleased to see this record come out - it's been a long tradition in jazz to play around with pop songs, and I thought it was an exceptional idea to choose them from this great Costello/Bacharach album.The result is terrible, however. Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here, no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level, Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire. Don't waste your money, this is an awful record.",__label__1
"all-round disappointment: I'm a big fan of Costello, a big fan of Bacharach, and through Deep Dead Blue, became a fan of Frisell. This combination seemed too good to be true, and actually, I was so looking forward to hearing it as one piece that I saved listening to it until I had a long car journey.Sadly, the Sweetest Punch is much less than the sum of the parts.I understand that Bill recorded it without hearing Elvis & Burt's finished album. I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat. Moreover it's just dull if you compare it to the rich, elegant, touching soundscapes of Painted From Memory.I am surprised that as someone with so much creative control over his output, Elvis didn't take Bill aside and suggest re-mixing or re-recording or simply not releasing.Sad really.",__label__1
"Is it just me....or....: Is it just me...or is there something strange about the sound of this album, as though the musicians are all slightly out of tune or it's being played on a tape recorder that's going a little bit below the usual speed? This effect is particularly noticeable on ""TOLEDO"".I loved ""Painted From Memory""- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g ""Painted from Memory"", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is ""God Give Me Strength"", which on all other recordings is amazing.",__label__1

This Is Not a Live Concert: Bought this DVD on the strength of the tape I had of the same concert broadcast on Showtime in the 90's. Thought the concert should have won a Cable ACE award it was so good. Couldn't wait to see the DVD version and when I heard the first vocals come out I couldn't believe that they had overdubbed new vocals over the originals.

We put it in, sat back, and after 5 minutes into the concert I was becoming agitated at what should be a great show. The music was great, but after 30 minutes I was going nuts. Then it dawned on me: the camera work is absolutely the worst. It's horrible. It detracts from the concert. It never stops moving. It never stops fading in & out. It jumps from one angle to another. It changes every few seconds and it never stops for the whole concert. A bunch of high school kids could have done better. I hope we can find another Tina concert worth buying but the Amsterdam concert was a waste of our money. What a cryin' shame.",__label__1

"Flawed but interesting fiction on Russian America: I can't help but think this book would have been far better as a non-fiction piece. The characters are not really that absorbing, and I feel that the narrator has much more to say about the experience of kayaking or canoeing the Northwest Coast from Sitka to Oregon than the fiction format allows him to. The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden). It is a man against nature story, but I suppose I found the nature part much more interesting than the men.A non-fiction reflection retracing this journey interwoven with the author's own thoughts probably would have been much more gripping.Still, it is worth reading nonetheless.",__label__2
"A Page Turner: Ivan Doag has captured my attention. After reading this great adventure story, I intend to order more books written by this author. His ability to create dialogue and tell a fascinating tale is remarkable. My only wish is for a sequel.",__label__2
Indelible impact: Sea Runners will etch the coastline of British Columbia in your mind. An awesome tale.,__label__2
big words used for big words sake: I have read other Ivan Doig books and found them immensely interesting but the phrasing and vocabulary in this book were very awkward. The descriptions would have been better if the author had not tried to use big words which made the voice of the book seem pretentious. I read it for a book club and had a hard time getting through it. The sad thing is that the story itself was interesting as were the characters. It was just an awkward book to read. It definitely was not a page turner. I don't think I shall ever read anything else by Doig which is a disappointment after reading others.,__label__1
"this book is SO BORING: sure its a bit funny, and it touches me cause i am a swede, but it seriously is not that good of a book. its just about rough seamean looking out at the BRISK sunrise. big words don't make a book good.i did NOT like this book, but im giving it some sympathy points, which is why it gets 2 stars.",__label__1
Rough Hewn Poetry: Descriptions of the Pacific Northwest are accurate and beautiful. The rhythm of the book captures the frustration of its characters and makes it part of your life. I felt I was on the sea paddling for seemingly forever. What kind of characters are required to make a superhuman effort? What kind of relationships are developed by disparate humans when pitted against great odds? Doig helps to answer these questions. This is a MUST READER for understanding the Pacific Northwest.,__label__2
"Wild Alaskan adventure: Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!",__label__2
"Pile of Junk - Save your money!: The first one I received the SD card slot lock did not work. The second one literally took 5 to 10 minutes to boot up. I returned it again to Discount Jungle (Amazon Seller) and they said they would not charge me the 15% restocking fee which they did anyhow.All in all, I wouldn't own another Sandisk MP3 even if they would give me one for free! I'm out $10.00 for two return shipments and another $10.00 restocking fee. Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different! Do a Google search for Sansa View slow start up, boot, or lockup.At least the FM Radio was nice....that's why it has a two star rating. I'd sure hate to see how well the re-manufactured units work.",__label__1
"Advice to potential buyers: Just wanted to mention a few things the other reviewers didn't. This player supports the WMA format which iPOD does not. I have the 8GB unit and expanded it with a 4GB MicroSD card. After adding the Micro SD card, the unit took about 90 seconds to start up, and battery life was reduced from 3 hours to about 30 minutes! Overall, I love it as a MP3 player, but would recommend you go with a unit with 16GB built-in storage if you think you'll need that much room.",__label__2

"cheap: After about 3 months things started going down hill really fast. After leaving it in the car on a summer day something went wrong with the with the power saver. I'd charge it over night and the next morning it would be dead. I'd listen to it for 5 minutes, turn it off, then turn it back on and it would be at half power. Recently the screen broke. That just gave me a good reason to get rid of it.Trust me, keep looking.",__label__1
"Overall problematic MP3 player: I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems, the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines. The rewind bar doesn't work either! you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding, but it'll resume right where it left off! I only give this player 2stars just because it's ease.",__label__1

I know that this is used-good condition but i didn't expect this.",__label__1
"Wow the battery life is bad!: If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!",__label__1
"Think twice about buying this player !: I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months, even though I didn't play it much. My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights. Suddenly and for no reason, I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player. With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so. I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there's a warranty problem !",__label__1
"Sansa View 8 GB: This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all. It's been a month now and I still haven't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item, but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping. Imagine that!",__label__1
"This Item is a Piece of Junk!: I am thourghly disappointed in this Sansas View. It deleted songs all the time wont keep them on wont connect to computer, if it keeps them it puts them on 3 or 4 times and when you detelted the dups.it deletes them all.",__label__1

"Malfunction and battery doesn't last long: Got this about 6 weeks ago. One week into it, the device started getting ""stuck"" on rewind. It's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel, which it still sometimes does successfully. About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice. It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality. This is my first MP3 player so I have no basis for comparison regarding battery life but it seems the battery drains very quickly.",__label__1
"Not good: Well, I only write reviews for things I dont like enough. Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great. I dropped and broke it. The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature. Unlike say an iPod, I can just listen to all kinds of music for $14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message 'Your tracks are not synchronized'. I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work. Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa, but I am seriously looking for other options for my music.",__label__1

After charging battery, I turn it on and while attempting to download an audio-book, the unit ""locked up"", All functions ceased, and I couldn't turn it off: back of player became very warm.

"SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series: This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after.",__label__1
"Hate this thing: I hate this thing. It worked for about a month and that is it. It has driver problems. After 5 hours on the phone with Rhapsody, 2 hrs. with Sansa it still does not work. I have downloaded everything for this. It does not work. Waste of money, time. Very disappointed.",__label__1
"Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.: Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.When plugging an 8Gb external microsd all the media from sd card is displayed twice in Sansaview. Forums have reported this problem in 2008 and this issues is still not fixed by Sansa even in the latest F/W.If you connect a 4Gb micro SD this issue goes away.If we remove the multiple listing of same items, I would love this player.The play button automaticaly aligns for landscape photo/video view. After I upgraded to latest F/W could see most of the videos, the firmware which came alongwith SansaView 1.01 could only play audio without showing the videos.To get the device upgraded need to connect in MSC mode which is not visible from the settings and the trick is to keep the ""Previous"" button pressed in ""hold"" mode while connecting the cable to laptop.",__label__1
"Great MP3 player!: This is a great MP3 player, and costs a lot less than an Apple equivalent. Shipping was fast. In case you want to sync some tracks from your computer to the Sansa View, connect it to your computer and call SanDisk support and they will ""activate"" the player remotely and you will be able to sync ever after. I downloaded to user manual. It is much more detailed than the skippy little guide that comes with the player. All in all I am very happy with this player.",__label__2
"Its a Cheap MP3 Player thats it: Its just a durable product with great sound quality, but don't expect anything more from it. The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use. You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device. No wonder, the product is priced so cheap.",__label__1
"Good Product-when it lasted.: This was a pretty good product until the damn thing just stopped working and just froze up when you tried to turn it on. I had it just over a year and after turning it on the device just went into bootup mode, never actually coming on. As long as I had it, it would frequently exhibit the same behavior. The only thing that would help was to take out the battery out and back in. Finally in the end, that did not help at all.The durability of the Sansa's line is poor at best.",__label__1
"Sansa GP3 Player is good for the value: My 13 year old son is very pleased with this product.The only problem I had with AMAZON is they marketed it on the screen with a protective skin and power cord to buy ""as a bundle"". Unfortunately, the skin that was shown on the screen did not fit. Not good, AMAZON!",__label__2
Excelent product!: I definitely like this. All the features that has makes this product smooth and easy to operate.Definitely recommended.,__label__2
"Horrible for long audio files: The player is awful if you are using it to listen to lectures; it only recognizes 25 minutes of an mp3. Plus, the fast forward function is EXTREMELY slow (to fast forward 10 mins would take about 3-4 minutes of holding down the button).Otherwise, it plays music fine, though the software on the mp3 player is no where near as nice as what you get with ipods (e.g. if you pull the headphones out of the jack it will pause the file, or it will remember the exact location in a file where you last left off instead of restarting a file if you turn the player off), but on the flip side it is also significantly cheaper.Overall, you get what you pay for.",__label__1
"Sandisk 8 gig black: Bought two units and after a few months one stopped working. Could get no info from the unit it was dead. Contacted Sandisk and ask for quick replacement. Offered to prepay to secure item would be shipped quick. Was told I did not need this. Item was bad and would be replaced with in a few days. After waiting a full month, I had to phone the Co on Ca. Manager told me the order had not been shipped and this some times happens. Had phoned the supply house in another state and player would be shipped.Worse customer support I have seen. Would not buy another unit from this Co. Manager I talked with sounded like a brain dead stoner. Might be why orders get lost.Order with caution and if you require replacement, prepare to follow up daily.",__label__1
"Did not work out of the box: I got the View for Christmas for my daughter after her Sansa Fuze died after several years of heavy use. It would never charge right out the box using both the USB or the electric charger I have for my own Fuse. I went online and tried everything the sandisk site said-nothing worked. Got the online chat who informed me that I had to use e-mail to resolve the issue since the View is a ""Legacy"" item. Sent an e-mail and never got a response. Their customer service department needs a lot... of help. On the plus side, sent it back to Amazon who gave A+++ refund service. Thanks Amazon!",__label__1
"Bad Luck?: The Sansa View 8GB I received was faulty. The battery would not hold a charge and/or the player would not turn on. This happened within hours of opening the player packaging and attempting an initial full-charge of the player's battery. The battery is only chargeable via USB and I tried using a PC and an AC to USB adapter to charge it. There is no hard reset button like I have seen on other players (namely Cowon brand players) so it could not simply be reset.I decided to return the product for a refund because it did not seem worth the trouble of waiting for a new (or repaired) player. I was not very impressed with the build quality of the player. It felt and looked very prone to scratching or other damage if not treated with extreme care. Furthermore, I found another player that suited my personal needs and desires better than the Sansa View.",__label__1
"Good Player - Bad Tech Support: I had no end of trouble getting it installed on my Vista computer. Tech Support was useless, apparently not admitting to the problem. I finally tried the forums and found a workaround. Finally working, the player is great for music and my Audiobooks, small, easy to use, generally just what I wanted.",__label__2

"ejects micro SD chip!: I was very happy with my Sansa View, until all of a sudden my micro SD chip was missing. I couldn't imagine someone stealing just a chip, but then when I tried to put a new one in, I noticed it would only be installed for a second or two before the spring inside the unit would expel the chip. It would actually launch it up 4-6 inches! So now I know my original chip is somewhere at the gym, certainly vacuumed up by now.It's a great player, but check to make sure your SD card doesn't come out too easily or just send it back!",__label__1
"One major criticism: Mostly very happy with this product, except the fact that it's dreadfully slow on fast forward or reverse. As you might imagine this can become very frustrating at times. And also totally unable to skip ahead to another part of the recording immediately similar to what the ipod can do.---C'mon Sandisk, give us some software to correct these serious inconveniences!!",__label__2
"Decent: Well, on the plus side it has great sound and good picture the ability to expand the memory and an FM radio(iPods don't have this feature). The downside it that the screen has a somewhat greasy look. This doesn't show very much during movies but it is a bit annoying. The screen scratches very easily so I would reccomend a case. When watching a movie, sometimes the whole thing freezes up and you have to turn it off and back on again. This is not horrible but it does get on your nerves after a while. The spin wheel is awesome ( I like it much better than the iPods because the spin wheel actually moves on the Sansa View). The whole thing is very easy to use and very user friendly. Overall this is a good product.",__label__2
"He likes it!: I bought this as a gift for my husband and the more he uses it, the more he is thrilled with it. Only downside is the weight.",__label__2
"Better than expected: THE SANSA VIEW IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. THE MUSIC SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD BUT LACKS BASS POWER. THE VIDEO PLAYER WORKS GREAT ONCE YOU FIND AN EASIER WAY THAN PROVIDED BY SANDISK. USING THEIR PROVIDED ""SANSA MEDIA CONVERTER"" WHICH CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THEIR WEBSITE TAKES HOURS TO CONVERT A MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW, BUT USING THE ""PSP MOVIE CONVERTER"" DOES THE JOB IN COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN DRAG AND DROP THE MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW USING RHAPSODY MEDIA PLAYER. ONCE I LEARNED TO DO THAT I BEGAN ENJOYING THE PLAYER. THE PICTURE VIEWER IS GREAT AS WELL. I ALSO OFFER THE FM RADIO FOR WHEN U WANNA HEAR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, DSEPERATE FOLDER FOR AUDIOBOOKS AND PODCAST, EXPANSION SLOT. A BANG FOR THE BUCK.",__label__2
"Love My MP3: I love this tiny MP3 player. Very easy to use. If you do have any problems, their customer support is great. I had to download a driver to get it going and I also called about another problem. They talked me right through everything and it all works well. I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio. The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort. I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music. To add videos and pictures it is necessary to dowload free software from the Sansa site. I feel this is a great product and it was better than I expected with a very reasoable price.",__label__2
"SANSA Sandisk 8 gb: I've had this product about 3 years now and use it everyday. I'm amazed at the quantity of music that I can put on it. I haven't used the video part of it, but, in a pinch have used it while DJing when my other equipment failed. I totally recommend this.",__label__2
"Nice player except.....: Nice player except the microSD card fails to be recognized anymore. The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure. I wouldn't recommend this (or perhaps any SanDisk product. This just SHOULD NOT happen.",__label__1
"if only it could last: This was my first mp3 player so i didn't neccessarily want anything fancy, just something with a decent sized screen. It worked pretty good for about a year. Then it began to randomly turn off. Usually when this happened i could turn it back on within a few minutes but this too ceased happening. I've now had it close to a year and a half and it cannot hold a charge at all. This would be fine if I only wanted to listen to it while it was charging, however I prefer my mp3 player to be portable. Do not buy this unless you prefer temporary dependability out of your electronics.",__label__1

"Save up and get a nano instead.: Whatever you do, avoid this product. I was lured by the lower price tag and as a group exercise instructor I needed something to lug all my music around on. I didn't want to lose my ipod (which I LOVE) so I got this instead.Well I've gone through two of them. You name the problem and I've had it. It has stopped working in the middle of a class I'm teaching, I've gotten the white screen of death, the display crapped out and for some reason it just stopped connecting to my computer. If I could give this zero stars I would. It will break if you look at it sideways.Sansa is replacing this for me, for the second time, but I'm going to buy another ipod instead because I just can't rely on this thing at all. I don't even think its worth giving to someone once the replacement gets here.DON'T BUY IT, YOU'LL REGRET IT!",__label__1

I charged it again, called Sansa about the issue and they agreed it was a bad battery after diagnosing the problem. They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away. Now I need to deal with Buy.com to see if they will give me my money back or replace the unit hopefully with a e200 series. The e200 series has inexpensive replaceable batteries.",__label__1
"Great player, bad job with the refurbish: We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players.",__label__1
"go with the view: I was upgrading from a Sandisk Sansa e280 4GB unit. This unit does a better job playing everything (audio and videos) and with a larger screen and longer battery life, I was sold. I think this unit is a great option if you want to avoid ipod and itunes.",__label__2
"OK but lots of bugs which never get fixed!: I'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product. I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers.",__label__1
"Great little mp3: I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there.",__label__2

I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before.

"I think I hate it: I had high expectations for this player. I have the Sandisk m240 and m250 and they have amazing sound quality so I thought, being from Sandisk, it would follow suit. It didn't. Very disappointed with the sound quality. It even breaks up. And forget about organizing you music and videos. You can't create folders on your own. Have to use Windows Media Player. And I still haven't figured out how to make video playlists. WMP won't accept mp4 files in the Video playlist. Plus, when scrolling through your library, the scroll wheel only goes forward so, if you want to play a song that begins with ""Y"" and don't what to start from ""A"" and scroll through 8GB WORTH OF SONGS all the way down to ""Y"" but want to scroll up from ""Z"" to ""Y"", you can't.",__label__1

"A few kinks, but overall it works well: Unfortunately it hasn't been all wine and roses w/my View but overall I would say that I'm satisfied with it. After having to return my first view due to battery problems the second one I got has worked great. It has been reliable (so far) and it's a breeze to load w/my music, photos and short home videos. The sound is fine with a little tweaking and creating my own equalizer setting. The screen rotates to landscape to show videos so you get the widescreen view, albeit on a very small screen. The wheel works well to glide through the menu as well as volume control. It feels solid though definitely not noticeable on my arm when I'm working out.",__label__2
"as good as an i-pod: well i had an rca 4108 was ok, but the headphone input circuit broke. so i went on a hunt looking for another. So i started to read reviews. this sansa was the best i've read and so far held up to it's reviews. I like it and would recomend it.",__label__2

"Sansa View ROCKS!!!!: I have had this Model Sansa View MP3 since it first came out in 2005-2006. It remains durable & in perfect working condition. I store music and pics on it and have never had any issues. I was my first and only MP3 player until I bought an iPhone this year (2011). However, I still use the Sansa View for the gym because it's light weight ( I also have the arm case that goes with it for working out). I highly recommend it if your are looking for a quality MP3 player. I purchase and download music from the web-sit it gives you at purchase and i also transfer music from my Windows Media Player on my PC. Too Cool!!!",__label__2
"Wow...: Alright so this thing really needs a warning label on it. ""WILL FREEZE WHEN TRYING TO SKIP SONGS"" This stupid contraption lead me in the end to just break it. It freezes up when I try and skip a song, I have to try and turn the damn thing off before I can even go to the main menu after I've used it for about a half hour. The battery life is great, really, but it's just not worth it when it's playing and it goes to the next song, but the screen says it's one minute into the last song previous it was playing. Basically, you can't skip the song if you wanted. Nice going Sansa, you made a piece of crap.",__label__1
"Not What I Had Expected: I had hoped for a more from Sandisk. After about 10 very frustrating days of trying to get it to work properly, the unit stopped altogether. The expansion memory never did work. It would only duplicate what was on the internal memory. Sandisk support was polite and tried to be helpful. Unfortunately, we were not in any way successful in getting the unit to work.

"flowerpots and spanish guitar: This is really a beautiful album. Micus plays all of the tracks by himself, on spanish guitar, zither, nay and flowerpots. The flowerpots are particularly interesting. They sound sort of like a marimba. The compositions are very interesting, and not at all sappy. I am sure micus cringes to see his music thrown in bins with world music and new age. It is not at all trite or commercialized. Some of the pieces include solo guitar, then some vibrant otherworldy rythmic flowerpot playing, back into solo guitar, generally quiet.",__label__2
"The best book I've read on public speaking: As a member of Toastmasters I have access to a wide variety of materials and seminars on public speaking. However, this one book covered more material in less space and in easier terms than all the seminars I've attended. His style is not that of a college textbook - if it were I wouldn't have read it. His style is straight from the hip. I consider this book to be my textbook, with Toastmasters providing the chance to practice what I've read. This book has done more to improve my speeches than the formal Toastmaster's evaluations.",__label__2
"Myth: Great speakers are born: Myth: Great speakers are born. Dale Carnegie's ""The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking"" may be a misnomer - it's not as easy as easy as the title may imply, but more importantly, he shows that it's nurture not nature that makes a great speaker. The book is filled with inspiring examples, tips and lessons. If you want to become a great speaker, this is a must read. You'll learn about the common pitfalls, the structure of the talk, the importance of introductions, conclusions, and much more. This book has stood the test of time and helped thousands of people, I'm glad to say that I'm one of them.",__label__2
public speaking book: I actually didn't finish this book. It had some good pointers within it but I felt it was doing more story telling than teaching me how to calm down and deliver a speech without my breakfest or lunch wanting to errupt.

Perhaps i should have read this garabage aloud instead.",__label__1

"Not what you're thinking: I've read this book as well as Carnegie's 2 other books, How to Win Friends & Influence People as well as How to Stop Worrying & Start Living. This one was a let down after those two, which i highly recommend (even with the old school references).This book stated a lot of common sense but nothing that I found I could use in off-the-cuff talks. In fact it, discourages that. It's also a bit of a dry read.While I admire his other books, I did not like this one.",__label__1
"Another Great Book by Dale Carnegie: I loved reading Dale Carnegie's books since I picked up How to Win Friends and Influence People. His writing style is very easy to read and he is always giving examples to make the content as clear as possible. That being said, The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking is a great book. I personally preferred How to Win Friends and Influence People over this book, so if you have not read that book, I would recommend reading it first. However, if you are specifically looking for a book on Public Speaking, Dale Carnegie is a great author and he has several books about this topic. This one is great and I recommend it.",__label__2

"Great Player/Radio/USB drive, but...: I ordered this great little player as a birthday gift to myself. It's outstanding except for one problem - The firmware is the unit as shipped was buggy! In version 1.04.3, any interrupted transfer to the device causes it to malfunction!I looked up the Creative support forum and dozens of people reported the same problem, namely a complete lockup of the unit and subsequent inability to ""boot"" it...My first unit failed after about fifteen minutes of playing with it, loading files, etc. Needless to say, I was distressed. Turns out YOU MUST UPDATE THE FIRMWARE as soon as you get it recharged. Another point I must strongly emphasize is that YOU MUST ""EJECT"" THE DEVICE under Windows BEFORE DISCONNECTING IT.I'm happy to report that firmware version 1.05.1 is much better and that I have not ""crashed"" since updating to it. I'm really enjoying it!I love this product and would give it 5 stars were it not for the buggy firmware that shipped with it. Cheers!",__label__2
"Great at First, but......: My daughter received this item as a Christmas gift. About a month ago it just stopped working.

They have promised three times to email me the forms to have it fixed or replaced...and nothing yet. I emailed the company again today. They do not have a customer service number that is toll free, and I am about done running up my phone bill.We were happy with it for the first 60 days or so, but now, I will never buy another ""Creative"" product again, based on their customer service.",__label__1

Search for ""rhomba firmware"" at google and visit Creative's European customer support forum page - there are oodles and oodles of Europeans with this same fatal error that they cannot recover from at all. People are throwing around unreleased firmware in that forum for this thing since Creative still has not released it. *sigh* another bug-ridden thing from Creative.

The cables that come with this unit contain LEAD which has been shown to cause CANCER and it is strongly suggested that you wash your hands after every time you touch them....Say What???!!!!

"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read, Don't Waste Your Time: I was so excited to see a new book on Frederick Douglass I didn't take time to preview the book. A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became.

"Big Dropoff: There is a huge dropoff in quality from Vol 1. of the Whistle Test clips to this package, simply because there is a huge dropoff in the quality of the artists between the two volumes. Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it.",__label__1
"Not a good followup...: The Old Grey Whistle Test hosted some incredibly groundbreaking FULL CONCERTS, two of which were the original Bob Marley and The Wailers, and Return To Forever (performing most of Romantic Warrior). Bootlegs of many of these shows are available but were recorded from nth generation tapes. Any one of these classic full shows would have been a much better choice for release than this hit and miss (mostly miss) collection of singles. I'm disappointed in this, and I believe they will be too once they see their sales numbers.",__label__1

That's my gross weight loss. I'm not even talking about how much fat i lost. I gained a good amount of muscle over the summer, so i probably lost over 15 lbs of fat. I got my six pack back, and life was great. After the season, i just quit, and now my six pack is back in the fridge. I'll probably order some up next week and start again. These are great, and the results are amazing.",__label__2

I felt like my appetite increased, I haven't lost any weight at all - in fact I've been fluctuating up and down 3 pounds for the past couple of weeks. I gave this two stars because I didn't feel the anxiety or sleeplessness that some people complained about, but I'm still disappointed.

With this cookbook, not only can you recapture some of that time but you can also serve up some absolutely scrumptious meals and snacks.

Semi- additive Cooking: Very disappointing The recipes are filled with unhealthy ingredients .The concept is great but the nutritional benefits are not there-- so it isnt a quick fix for me.Hard to imagine Wolfgang endorsing such a book,__label__1
"Barely edible: I am all for shortcuts in the kitchen and I am not a health nut or a food snob, but I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of recipes in this book that were edible. Most of them were seriously lacking in the flavor department. The fact that most of them are very poor, nutrition-wise, also concerned me a lot. She seems beholden to too many ingredients that are high in fat and sodium, as well as chemicals and preservatives. I mean, why use artificial coffee creamer in an eggnog recipe? I received this book as a gift, from a well-meaning friend. I would have much rather gotten one of rachel Ray's books, as she really knows how to make fast and simple meals from fresh ingredients.",__label__1
"Don't be fooled by these books,: just because the recipe says to use pre-made ingredients doesn't mean you can't take the extra time to make as many of them from scratch that you can, like shredding your own cheese, cutting up a onion, or making your own mashed potatoes, etc. I sub as many fresh ingredients as I can for the pre-packaged and I still have a good meal made in no time. That may defeat the purpose of the cookbook, BUT, the recipes are what stand out, and any can me made with fresh or pre-packaged items.They are good, everyday family meals. The photos and lay out are outstanding, and the books are well priced for the quality we get from them. Worth the money.",__label__2

Open with a Raspberry Sake, move to a Crabby Bisque of condensed crab bisque enhanced with heavy cream and crabmeat, then use the slow cooker to produce Chinese Braised Short Ribs or Southern Pulled Pork - or top it off with Cinnamon Buns made from frozen white bread dough enhanced with spices, sugar, and butter.",__label__2
Not a practical book: This oversized book does not lie flat unless you are using a recipe from the center pages. I tried cans and a rolling pin to weigh down the pages and nothing worked.

This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes. Check the labels; if you see chemicals, don't eat it! If you care about your health, you will stay clear of Sandra Lee.",__label__1

Frustrated, I asked the store mananger who told me that the products I was looking for, Campbell's fat-free mushroom soup and Jello refrigerated vanilla pudding cups are no longer available in my area.Why make such a big fuss about using this or that brand when they aren't even available? I won't waste any more time travelling around town looking for the exact brand names needed to make the recipes in this book.I have better things to do!

"WHAT is the point of this show???: Sandra Lee has nerve calling what she does ""cooking."" Putting together a bunch of boxed ""ingredients"" and dumping them into different bowls is not ""cooking."" Too bad we aren't seeing professional chefs cut down Lee with the same ferocity they do with Rachael Ray.I get nauseous just thinking about the amount of sodium and everything else that's in all those bags of packaged food that she uses (and why all the mixed drinks? Maybe Lee can put together a show about how to make mixed drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic - because she seems to know all about them).To think she follows Ina Garten (who can actually cook) Monday-Thursday, is indicative of the fact that The Food Network doesn't have a whole lot of requirements as to who gets a show on their channel.",__label__1
"Help for the holidays: With the holidays coming, I knew I would have even less time and even more to do than usual so when I saw this book I knew it was just what I needed. Some of the recipes are fairly basic, like the lasagna, but there are other more exotic dishes that I can't wait to try, the shangra la lobster being one. I tested some of the appetizer and dessert recipes for holiday parties and they were easy easy easy and looked and tasted amazing. This is a terrific resource for the holidays and all year.",__label__2
"A must read: Both sad and hilarious at the same time, this book is a must read for anyone who wonders at our current criminal justice policy.

"A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN TRUE CRIME!! RIVETING!!: Last year I found this book and once I opened it I could not put it down. Bugliosi is excellent at bringing the details to life on the page. Not only do we get a first hand account of the trial, but he also explains much of the legal process in very clear and understandable terminology. I am now a fan of his work and will be reading everything I can of his.",__label__2
"Sheer madness, meticulously documented: Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called ""Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It."" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read.",__label__2
The weirdest plot ever and it's all true.: I remember last year around Halloween I read an article about the best books to read for Halloween. Even the article's author conseded that this was a strange choice (it's not fiction) but had a good point. The first 10 pages of this book are truly terrifying and I guarantee you will be affected. It is also very hard because you can't help but feel desperate for the victims because terror was a part of what these killers meant to put into their last moments of life. And as most who know about this case it was one of the most horrible crime scenes to ever be discovered.,__label__2
"the most exciting book i've ever read. i loved it!!!!!!: I thought this book was magnificent. The way Vincent Bugliosi described everything in such depth. I found some of it to be dragging in the beginning, but am I glad I didn't give up on this one. The chilling reality is what got to me the most.",__label__2
"This Book Will Scare The Hell Out Of You: Vincent Bugliosi isn't kidding when he writes on the very first page ""The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You"". Bugliosi somehow finds a way into the sick and distorted mind of Charles Manson, as he was the prosecutor during Manson's trial. He remembers small details from long ago, never moving over to another topic. ""Helter Skelter"" is a great albeit terrifying book.",__label__2
"Wonderful book: This is the wonderfully engaging tale of how Bugliosi successfully prosecuted the Manson Family for the August 1969 murders. However, if you wish to learn a lot about the backgrounds of the ""family"" members, this is not the book for you. This book is from a law-enforcement point of view. If you pick up this book hoping to learn about Manson and his philosophy, you'll be disappointed. However, if you want to know how the players were implicated and prosecuted, there's no better book.",__label__2
"Super Scary and Fascinating: Charles Manson is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the story. My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing.",__label__2
Real reason behind the murders was to free Bobby Beausoeil.: Helter Skelter motive is a little far out. Real reason for murder was a copycat of Beausoeil's murder of Gary Hinman.,__label__2
kindle edition warning ...no pictures: what permissive issues could ban all photos...a crock to scam full price from Kindle users. Buy a used ppb edition for 35 cents...far more gratifying. Dont let them get away with this.,__label__1
"Helter Skelter: I was 16 years old the summer of 1969 and remember it vividly. I didn't read Helter skelter until I was 22, when it first came out and learned for the first time many of the detail, and the book truly stays in your mind. That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves. Bugliosi wrote with such compassion for the victims and we can truly thank him that these people are behind bars now. Watching Charles Manson talk on television shows how unremorseful he is and will always be.",__label__2
Amazing.: I had no idea the Manson family was so much more widespread than the one murder everyone hears about. Mr. Bugliosi does a great job presenting the history and breaking down the various individuals involved. A really riveting and informative read. Would definitely recommend this book.,__label__2
"The plague that this book has caused.: Have any of you not read the Manson File? It is obvious that you cannot control people with LSD, and it is obvious in the fact that Manson did not kill anyone.",__label__1
"Too bad the book is completely fiction...: The fact of the matter is this book is total fiction, the elaborate work of Vincent Bugliosi's imagination due to due his ignorant and superstitious ""ideology"".He needed to give ""evil"" a face... and Manson was convenient.""Helter Skelter"" has made Bugliosi wealthy beyond belief.I guess whatever sells a book, right? Charles Manson, a human being... was simply collateral damage.",__label__1
"Outdated, Innacurate, Self-agrandizing: Watch the Movie: I realize that this is the first book a person will come to when searching on MANSON. However, you should really just skip it and watch the Made-for-TV movie which cut out all of Bugliosi's egotisical grandstanding and actually did a much better job of revealing what it was like to be in that circus of a court-room. The film also accurately depicts how much Bugliosi relied on the statements of tripped out Family members who did not participate in the killings in order to construct his ""Helter Skelter"" theory of the Crime. Do yourself a favor and buy CHARLIE'S FAMILY by Jim Vanbebber available here at Amazon.com in addition to this book. The two will show you the opposite ends of the theoretical spectrum on the Manson case.",__label__1
"the classic pulp novel is still selling fast: Bugliosi's ghost writer for this one crafted a skillful tale of the heroic prosecutor deciphering the real motive of the murders, despite the incompetence of the police department. You should know that practically everyone who studies the Manson case in detail regards this book as a work of fiction, the same way they regard Bugliosi's ridiculous made-up motive of ""trying to start a race war"". There is some info here that is hard to get elsewhere, but otherwise this is simply an attempt to sensationalize and make money. There are far better books you can read on the Manson case.",__label__1
"Helter Smelter: Vincent understands nothing about the intricate inner workings of the mind of Charles Manson. He totally misses the point. It would be nice if The Beatles were mystical figures from The Bible, and possesed god like powers to influence The Family towards committing any unpleasantness. Doesn't Vincent know that Charlie only listens to the music of Bing Crosby?",__label__1
"Gratuitous slasher porn: In this decade of fear, the drama of the Manson family murders is making a comeback. Unfortunately, it's still the same self-aggrandizing slasher-porn that it was in 1974. In amongst pages upon pages of case minutiae (this overlong monster weighs in at 713 pages), Bugliosi alternates between gratuitous gore and telling us what a great prosecutor he is. I used to blame OJ and Court TV for turning the judicial system into mass entertainment, but apparently Bugliosi mastered this dubious art years ago.",__label__1
"Helter Skelter: The DA's own fabrication: This story is not the true story of the murders, but the concoction of VB. The whole Helter Skelter theory was in his mind and in his mind only-he saw ahead to the book deal and movie. Of all the seat's in the court room, over 98% were taken by media. He played into their hands by making up this totally outrageous story (prompted by a liar Sadie and turn coat,get me outta my legal mess Danny DeCarlo). This is fiction. And by the way, Charlie wasn't even present at any of the murder scenes, nor did he order any murders, so why is he in prison? Because he received an unfair trial at the hands of VB. This book is NOT recommended.",__label__1
"Blood Fest 1969: The chilling story as told by detective Bugliosi will scare and shock you to your utmost. There is an eerie sense all about you that keeps you wondering how such diabolocal people could exist in this world. In all its gorey details and brutally honest depiction of the Manson ""Family"" Bugliosi does not shield the reader from the horrrid acts committed. He is forthright in his personal fellings toward the murders and his perception of the Manson ""Family"" including their theology that ""Helter Skelter"", the final war between the balcks and the whites, is the most outrageous in all of history, which made everything in connection to the murders just as strange.",__label__2
"Great Read: This is a great book so far. I am a little farther than halfway into it and it is great. Although the writing is a little choppy at times, it is definitely worth it.",__label__2
"Through the eyes of Bugliosi: This book truly lives up to what Vincent Bugliosi says on the first page of his book ""Helter Skelter-The True Story Of The Manson Murders""-- ""This story you are about to read will scare the hell out of you."" This is not only the best true crime book ever written, but it is the ONLY true crime story ever written. Mr. Bugliosi is truly a judicial genius, and should be highly commended not only for putting Charles Manson, Susuan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel, Leslie Van Houten, and Charles Watson behind bars forever so they can never harm another living soul again, but for writing this fantastic but bone-chilling book.",__label__2
"Amazingly horrific: I've always been fascinated by the Manson family story...not in a sick and twisted way, but just the fact that one man had the power to control all of these people and could manipulate them to brutally murder completely innocent people for him for no reason. This book had so many details that I wasn't even aware of, and it made me feel like I was with the investigators and lawyers all the way from the discovery of the bodies through the trials. I would recommend it for anyone that is interested in this story.",__label__2
"AMAZING!!: Helter Skelter was the absolute best true crime book I have ever read. From the very beginning, the book captures you into the lives of the murderers, victims, and prosecutors. It does a remarkable job at building the story line so that you are not overwhelmed with information, but are still well informed with details and specifics. I also loved that the book went into the past of Charles Manson and the ""family"". Over all this was an EXCELLENT book, and it was very hard to put down!!",__label__2
"""Helter Skelter"": the Kindle edition review: All of the good things said about ""Helter Skelter"" is true of the Kindle edition. What's more the Kindle edition has hyperlinked footnotes that actually work and take you instantly to Bugliosi's notes. But the trade-off is that with the Kindle edition THERE ARE NO PICTURES because of licensing issues. The print edition has lots of pictures, but many of the crime-scene photo's are censored.",__label__2
"Mind Blower!: This book is absolutely riveting! It seems that only a couple of books a year can hold my attention like this one - which is a shame. I always have a sense of loss after reading a great book. The whole Manson paradigm is so bizarre and twisted that it just blows your mind. I read this book over a long rainy weekend and could not put it down. If you like fascinating stories where reality is stranger than fiction, this is THE book you should read. Top notch!",__label__2
True crime written well: This book was a fast and intense page turner. It was scary and interesting since watching and reading the case in the news. The book was well written by the prosecutor. I recommend this as a read because it was one of the crimes of the century.,__label__2
"YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK: THIS AN AMAZING BOOK, I WAS VERY SPELLBOUND WHEN I READ THIS. ICANT BELIVE HOW ONE PERSON COULD BE SO SICK IN THE HEAD AND ALL THEKIDS HE HAS HAD IT IS GROSS.

"Helter Skelter The Manson Murders: while this book is factually interesting, it is sometimes a little boring. The author drones on a little too much at times and I found myself skipping passages and sometimes whole pages just to make progress through the book. On the whole a good read which reflects how things were at the time of the Manson Murders but ultimately a little unsatisfactory, somehow.",__label__2
"Some interesting moments.: 'Helter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murders' is an examination of Charles Manson and his cult and the bizzare trial that occurred during the late 1960s and early 1970s. I read the book to see what the Charles Manson hype was all about. There was some interesting moments, but most people in this generation would not be impressed with someone like Manson. It is surprising that he was able to hold the power over those people like he did.",__label__2
"Kindle version of this book is NOT coimplete: Amazon won't tell you, and you will learn only after you pay for this Kindle title: it has no illustrations or photos and has regrouped the footnotes to the point of making them worthless. A very disappointing result for a fine book with great crime history relevance. This title should NOT be purchased for Kindle if you are expecting to receive an honest copy of the complete book! I will not trust other Kindle titles because unless you own a print copy of a Kindle title you will never know what was omitted, removed or edited to fit an obviously limted format.",__label__1
great and insghtful: well written and informative. I finished the whole 689 page book in one week and three days. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,__label__2
Most interesting: This book by Vincent Bugliosi is by far the best book I have ever read. The Manson murders being the most interesting subject I have ever researched. Being the prosector in the longest trial in American history the author is also an extremly good writer! I recommend this book to anyone and it is well worth the money,__label__2
"Surprisingly Witty!: I purchased this thinking it would be a very dry read. I was very pleasantly surprised at, not only how well-written, but how witty this book truly is! I even laughed out loud at some of Bugliosi's comments, which is astonishing considering the murderous content of the book.It really speaks for itself that after three decades, this book is still a literary staple!",__label__2
"Bugliosi Brings Out Manson's True Darkness: Helter Skelter is one of those books that leave you in dismay because you can't believe the logic in the Tate-LaBianca murders. The ""family"" is truely an unbelievable group of people that absolutely butchered for the begining Helter Skelter. I would strongly recomend it to anyone.",__label__2
"DAWN'S REVIEW OF HELTER SKELTER: Helter Skelter is a very interesting book. Almost every page keeps you on the seat of your chair. It doesn't have a slow moment in it. It has details after details in which you really enjoy. The feeling of it being all real and true kept me reading this book Just think a person like that is still out there, waiting to be released. If that doesn't scare you then I don't know what will. The reality of this book is so increadible that you think it is all made up,but it is all so true. It is certainly a page turner, but I have to warn you, it will scare the hell out of you!",__label__2
"Very Accurate, but somewhat mysterious: I Thought that the Book Helter Skelter, was very informative as well as vivid in telling about the true Manson crimes.It was a great description of the various people and deaths of the people there in Los Angeles, Cali. This book also is a great account of the death of the actress, Sharon Tate. This is a great book to help you find out more about the Manson crimes, the many deaths, and the use of the HELTER SKELTER to posses the murders.",__label__2
"What else can I say? The definitive telling of the Manson murders.: ""Helter Skelter"" is the first and only book I have ever read regarding Charles Manson and his followers, and after having finished it, I can't imagine ever needing to read another. Bugliosi goes over the Tate/LaBianca crimes in minute detail, and even covers earlier murders committed by Manson and the family that most people might not know about. Even though the basic details of the story and the outcome of the trials are already known, Bugliosi's telling is enthralling and at times I had difficulty in putting the book down. Highly recommended.",__label__2
"Real Life Horror Story: This book is not for everyone. It is extremely scary and disturbing. At the same time, it is a fascinating look at the police work and prosecution that brought the murderous Manson Family to justice. The book is hard to put down; the in depth discussion on presenting a criminal case in court and developing evidence to support the case is outstanding. The main complaint is that the book is a few hundred pages too long. The author seems a little too self-promoting, but then again he did get a prosecution on one of the biggest murders in history.",__label__2
"Good for the story itself, not the writing: This book is endlessly fascinating because the Manson story is endlessly fascinating and because Bugliosi (the prosecutor) and Curt Gentry (the real writer) manage to avoid sensationalism. But it's really a pedestrian work, eminently readable, but nowhere near the level of Capote (In Cold Blood) or Mailer (The Executioner's Song).",__label__2
"READ MULTIPLE TIMES! EXCELLENT!: This is the best true-crime book ever written, imho. I actually read this in high school in the 1970s and did a book report on it for one of my history classes (got an ""A""). It seemed like none of the other kids had ever heard of Manson or his ""family"". I read this book so many times the cover was in pieces. If you want to read a scary, gory, and TRUE book that will scare you, don't bother with any of the other books out there. Read this one. It will give you chills to realize how much control one man can have over other people. Of course, since the time of the Tate/LaBianca murders, we have been desensitized because of the Jim Jones, David Koresh, and other cults... But Manson's directives started them all. Very well written.",__label__2
bad book: it is literally a step by step account of the investigation of the whole Manson murders. I have never been more bored with a book in my entire life.,__label__1
"This is NOT the true story of the Manson Murders!!!: This book is well written and highly detailed but it cannot be farther from the truth. Mr. Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter's"" theory is just laugh out funny, plainly ridiculous. This is Bugliosi's story, not Charlie's. The biggest mistake you can make is buy bugliosi's story of the events and believe Charlie as the mastermind of the killings. But I won't lie, I couldn't put this book down. It would've been great if it were true, but it's not.",__label__1
"A masterpiece of cool jazz, funk and classical music: I just love this album. I have owned the original album since 1979 and when my eyes fell on the CD in one of our local shops about seven years ago now, I didn't have to think twice and bought it straight away. I still love to listen to it once every so often. The recording quality is just superb, especially on the acoustic recordings! A jazzfunk masterpiece, with a great rythm section (Andy Newmark and Ralph MacDonald), funky bass (Gary King), Bob James on keyboards and the cool and sophisticated flute of the man himself. Huberts interpretations of Ravel's 'Forlane' and Tchaikovsky's 'Romeo and Juliet' are just awsome. Played with tremendous virtuosity, perfect timing and outstanding deliverance! If you are in to jazz and funk but you love your classical music too, you are going to be hooked, I know I am!",__label__2
"extremely dull: I will admit, I had to read this for class, but I couldn't have been more bored. It just follows our little monk to be in his going crazy.But lets face it, if you are even looking at this book here, you are either really interested in this type of novel, or have to read it for school/business/other required reading",__label__1
"A Good Book: This is a good book, but it does have some issues.If you happen to be looking at the Hardcover Import from 1994, there is an introduction from Donald Keene. In this introduction he pretty much gives all of the story away, including the final sentence of the book, and all the main events from the book. Luckily I caught on to this quickly and skipped most of the introduction, and read it after the story. This has happened in other books Ive read and I am unable to find a reason why these kinds of introductions are put at the beginning of the book.On a final note, the book can get slow and your eyes may start wander when the main character goes off on his long talks about his feelings and philosophical things, but if you can get past this, points will pop up in the book that keep you interested until the end. I recommend reading the book, and I will buy more books from this author.",__label__2

"too long and boring read: This book is too long and the story too convoluted to be enjoyable. I mean, I appreciate the efforts of the author (thus the 2 stars) to document the historical context and to give details to make it more believable, but this is way too much. I had to force myself and jumped many pages to go on in the reading. The characters were unpleasant too. I don't understand where the romantic shade of Reynaud is, when he forces Elise to take every step in their relationship. He doesn't allow her any choice in a misinterpreted attempt to free her from her restraints against the men (more than justified, I'd say). Elise, on the other hand, resents his savage behavior, but never fails to focus only on the ""gentleness and thoughtfulness"" of Reynaud. Finally, she realizes, against all the evidences, that he is not an overbearing man, but a kind, lovable person. No, I definitely didn't get it.",__label__1
"Impossible: This set was so complicated that we are returning it. My 8 year old cannot figure it out nor can any of the adults who have tried. The instructions are incomplete.

Finally, we gave up and repacked it all.",__label__1

Otherwise there are 5 other sample structures wwhich have no building instructions and that is it.I put this completely in the category of good idea but bad reality. It is a pity, really, since it would take the manufacturer little work to produce a variety of projects with real instructions. I encourage the manufacturer to do so.",__label__1
"Impossible to use: I bought this for my 10 year-old son. He's an experienced builder, having put together many lego creations and k'nex kits with little or no help from a grownup. He couldn't assemble the tanks. The green collars that are used to connect tank sections are very tight (to keep water in, I suppose), and he just didn't have the coordination or strength to push them together. I was able with much, much effort, to get two sections of a tank connected, but I couldn't even get the top on.I called the help number and left a message. So far, no response.The girders are also not very well designed and come apart with a little jostling.I wish I'd never bought it. My son really, really wants to see it work and so far we've spent many hours to no avail.",__label__1
"Older kids like it...: ...like me! Well, I like that my teenage son is having fun. All the other reviewers seem to have 10 year old sons. This really looks like you could make a good simulation of an industrial plant. But not with the manual they give you. They give you pictures of what an ice cream factory or a plastics plant might look like--but no explanation at all why they are set up that way, or what is doing what. Too bad; there is a lot of untapped potential here.It was fun to see the same old girders like the girder and panel set I had decades ago. Except now the girders are black instead of red. The plastic seems less brittle than I remember, so there is less danger of the little pins breaking off.If your son or daughter has any inclination of going into chemical engineering, this is just the thing!",__label__2

Another thing that bugs me about this book is that some of the answer keys in the back don't match the corresponding puzzles. When I get to the difficult/Very Challenging ones in the back, sometimes I need a little help!

Eric Flint is on that list. He has done some very nice collaborative work, so I looked forward to reading FtM. OOPS! WRONG BOOK!

"Pass On This One: For those of you who enjoyed THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER stand by for some severe disappointment. This sequel/prequel to TPS just doesn't measure up. FORWARD THE MAGE is for the most part dreadfully boring. While some of the story line sparks a little interest, primarily the relationship between Benvenuti and Gwendolyn, the rest is pretty dull stuff. The extremely long ramblings of the wizard Zulkeh are especially trying. The frequent attempts at humor are forced and not particularly funny, kind of like a drunk at a party who thinks he's hilarious but isn't. It makes you almost embarrassed to read it.Well no need to spend a lot of time on this dog. Read THE PHILISOPHICAL STRANGLER, it is funny and worth the effort. You won't miss much except a little of the background which really isn't needed to begin with. If you REALLY feel you must read MAGE then check it out of your local library, but don't turn it in late, it's not worth the fine!This book is NOT RECOMMENDED!",__label__1
"All foam - no beer: I usually like Flint and have read everything he published. This is the biggest single book and by far the worst. The book is supposed to be a comedic fantasy. Maybe it is. If you are looking for a book where everything is supposed to be funny and nothing is to be taken seriously, maybe this is your book, but I pitched it after 66 pages.",__label__1
"put it down after a few chapters: Well I'm not sure if Eric Flint has had a siezure of some sort or whether the execrable dialogue belongs to Richard Roach. It _might_ be an attempt at humour however it merely succeeds in being tiresome. The book also assaults you with trite banalities such as having gravity discovered by someone called 'oldgram' (new-ton .. get it). As a general rule anyone who resorts to witless-isms like this can't have much to say. Had to put it down. Maybe I'll finish it when I'm desperate for reading material and I've finished all the adds in the paper. Pity really, I _like_ Eric Flint's other work.",__label__1
Too wordy....: I got this book cuz I enjoyed the Philisopical strangler book. I found this book entirely too wordy. I enjoyed certain parts of the book.

"Great product!: Hey GuysThanks for the product, arrived swiftly and is in great working order really happy! What an awesome movie go SA!!!",__label__2
"Great value - now: These once cost nearly $3000, but I got my z557 for about 1/15th of that. I've had it for over six months and used it for radio, TV, DVD movies, Internet video (full-screen HD) and general computing. With 2GB of RAM and Vista Ultimate, it actually runs really well. My keyboard isn't as bad as what was written about, here, but it is not the kind of keyboard you would use for more than surfing, anyway. And, it will take any USB keyboard or keyboard/mouse, wireless, or otherwise. I'd recommend using a wired LAN instead of its weak wireless. And, it can seem like it's running hot, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem. If you have the room, it's a decent all-around system, looks good and is nicely built.",__label__2
"Utopian fantasy: Hogan is a member of that group of sci-fi writers who present bold ideas but don't particularly write well or develop characters (Isaac Asimov is the first, and best, member of that school of Sci-Fi writers.) His idea seems rather weak to me as ignores human (mainly male) nature. We have had thousands of years of war, sexism and the exclusion of various ""outsider"" groups (based on caste, race, tribe, income, etc.) Even studies of chimpanzees, humans closest relatives, have shown certain ""outsider"" males are physically abused by the ""alpha males"" of the group. Look at the primary source texts and warlike art of civilizations from the Aztec to the Sumerians and you will see intolerance is a problem of the y-chromosome, not social conditioning from one particular society. Matriarchy might be the only real answer to the world's problems.",__label__1
"Found it Irritating: Though the book had some good plot points, I found the overall tone offensive. Mr. Hogan is apparently an atheist or agnostic, and believes in evolution. In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias. I will not be wasting my money on any more of his books.",__label__1
"Yesteryear: I have read this book several times since it was first published and find it enjoyable each time I read it. The chacarters he builds in this book are great. It's a book to read when you wish to lay back and dream about how good ""US"" humans are .......and how fanatical some of ""US"" can be. If you enjoy Mr. Hogans books you will greatly enjoy this good story. I have read all of Mr. Hogan's books and enjoy them all. I can't wait to see where his next story will take me.",__label__2
"Great Science Fiction: I read books for ""escapism"" and for the pleasure of reading. I'm not a political or social scientist, so evaluating a work of fiction on that basis is meaningless to me.Simply put... It's a very good story that is both easy to read and hard to put down. I loved it.",__label__2
"This book could have been good.: The book starts out well, but the author's explanation of social evolution contradicts the biological evolution Hogan likewise promotes in this book. This story could have been good other than the author's scientific and semi-moralistic inserts. At some points I had the feeling that he was trying to rationalize his own beliefs by authoring them in the book almost separate from the story.",__label__1
"A book to read again and again: A few years ago I bought a second hand copy of this book. During this time I must have read it at least once a year. I like it that much.It is a book about what humanity could aspire to become if we can put away the mistakes of the past and present.The arguments I've read that this is a unrealistic fantasy.... this is a book of fiction that portraits the thought and maybe the wishes of the author. You can agree with them or not.This is one of the few books that I would recommend to a beginning SF reader. It is not too difficult and a pleasure to read, and unlike many other books you are not left with a feeling of light depression because every main character died or had some other terrible fate happen to them.If you are interested in other works of Mr. Hogan I would recommend 'The Giant Novels' and 'The Genesis Machine'.",__label__2

"Poor Design, Construction & Quality: We purchased six of these heaters in February 2006, and by November 2006 only one was still working. One was DOA, two died within one week of arrival, and the other two died over the next seven months. We live in Southern California so these heaters were rarely used so its not like they wore out. Repeated calls to DeLonghi customer service went unanswered, and the local service company they refer to in their service manual is no longer in business. We are very disappointed with the heaters and DeLonghi and would not buy one from them again.",__label__1
"One hundred stars...: ...would not be enough for this extraordinary treasure trove of intelligence and beauty. You get to see Gould in real time, talking at length about the music that meant everything to him -- not just Bach and Schoenberg, but Richard Strauss. Mahler, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Beethoven, among others. These are complete programs, so you get to marvel not only at the transcendent performances but at the ease with which Gould enters into, say, a Bach fugue, whether for a few measures or for the entire piece, and then reemerges to deliver some extraordinary insight in a mannered but impeccable spoken prose... This set is the bargain of the century at the present amazon price ($72.99) but even if it goes back up to list price the decision to buy this would be a no-brainer. Wow.",__label__2
"Pretty entertaining: Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far. There is a lot of content for the money and it is funny to see what Canadien Broadcasting was like several decades ago. Oh, and there is some good piano playing as well. Gould seems like he was an interesting, if not a little strange, person. It's sad that he died so young of a stroke.",__label__2
"Wings Above the Diamantina: If you like detective novels you should enjoy this one. It is well written. Set in the Australian outback, the detective, Napoleon Bonaparte, is half white, half aborigine and makes full use of his native skills. He informs the reader of the progress he is making in solving the mystery as he discovers the clues, while still maintaining the suspense. This is an interesting and complex mystery.",__label__2

"Jabra EarGels: This is an excellent product to use for a bluetooth headset. I use it with the Samsung Wep200 and it fits perfectly. It comes with several different sized gels, which can be shared with family members. This product finally allows me to use my bluetooth without worrying about the headset falling from my ear during normal use.",__label__2
"Not worth the $2.99: I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds. I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one. Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs! If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking.",__label__1
"Glad they were under ten bucks.: Save your money. The eargels split in two days. I used regular ear buds on the large size. They did hold the buds in the ear better, but no gain in sound quality. If you want the small and med, I'll send them to you for shipping. I have no use for them.",__label__1
"Hardly worth the whole $2.95 I paid for them.: I have ear gels before, but none that were this cheap (and I don't mean cost!). There was no consistency in the size (they come in different sizes, but no two were the same). And without fail, every single one I tried to use split in half after being installed on the ear piece. Every one! It didn't seem to matter if they were small or larger -- or even larger than the ear piece. The material just began tearing from both sides and ended up falling off in ever instance.I am sure there must be a better quality version of these things somewhere. I seriously do not recommend these to anyone.",__label__1
"Good Deal: Very pleased with EarGels & was surprised how fast they arrived. Certainly makes a big difference in being able to use my Jawbone, which would not stay in my ear with any of the factory supplied ear molds. Jawbone would do well to cut a deal with Jabra to furnish Ear Gels with all their Jawbones. Use it about 75% more now. Thanks for a good deal & fast shipping.",__label__2
"Jabra Eargels: Looking for something to work with my Jawbone ICON. The set consists of 3 pairs of eargel (three sizes). Found the size that fit and inserted the ICON. Works OK, but not as snug as I would like on my right ear. Tried the left ear one and it was much better; fit was better and sound was louder. Tried several types of earphone adapters, and these seem to work better than most. If you have a problem with fit on one ear, try the other one.",__label__2
"the keep my icon and my jabra extreme where they belong.: Works great, fits better. Works with a range of headsets. I use it with a jawbone iciness and a jabra extreme. The gels are comfortable, and fit quite well. Before buying these I was seriuosly thinking of a custoel. Th ese are almost the well fitting. Biggest issue is that the material hardens and may need replaced in about 6 months, but for the price I can live with that.",__label__2
"Completely Worthless: These may work for some people, but for others like me, they're worthless. The fit was horrible and they did not stay in my ear. They also caused my Jawbone Prime to protrude far enough so that the front part no longer touched my face (which is required for their noise reduction circuitry to work). I threw these away and am now using the stock earbud with the ear hook.These are designed for people with a certain ear shape. If your ears don't conform to this shape (which is likely the case for many people), these will be useless. If you want these, I suggest buying from a local store where you might be able to try them on, or at least to return them without having to pay return shipping.",__label__1
"Jabra ear gel: Product works perfectly with jawbone 2. Ease of use without needing to change anything on ear peice. Will need to decrease volume when using the nanda ear gel. Getting good fit easy with the differen sizes provided. Soft material makes comfortable for extended use , and no need for the ear loop.",__label__2
"Junk,Don't wast your money.: I got these in hope It would give me a good fit to my jawbone 2, but they did not work for me. I think they even made it less of a fit.",__label__1
Jabra EarGels: These EarGels make using my Jawbone I for long periods of time much more comfortable. I just put the EarGel over the existing ear button and it fits just right in my ear. No need to push and shove to get it seated and tight. Makes for a better drive when I am not always pushing in on the Jawbone to make sure it stays put. Great addition to any bluetooth earpiece that it will fit.,__label__2
"Makes a Jawbone 2 better: I hated the fit of my Jawbone 2.0. It would never stay in no matter which ear loop or ear bud I used. Someone recommended these to me, so I thought I'd give them a try. After 2 months of using it, I'm pissed I didn't get them sooner. Before chucking your Jawbone 2.0, try these.",__label__2

"THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING OF HE JABRA EARGELS.: I have a jawbone headset, before I have read some review on the website everyone is recommend to buy the jarbra eargel to go with my jawbone, I found that is very untrue, before I was using with the hook, my jawbone never fell out of my ear, but when I first wear my jawbone with eargels. it kept on fell out of my ear. so I stop using them, to me a a waste of money, I like my jawbone the way it is. and it's comfortable for my usage as well. could be happy than that.",__label__1
POOR: GOT THIS PRODUCT TO USE WITH A BLUETOOTH. NO INSTUCTIONS ON HOW TO FIT OR USE IT.SIZES DIDNT FIT MY EAR.,__label__1
Great Item: I am very happy with this product. They are very comfortable and come with 3 diffrent sizes that should work for most people. My only gripe is that they don't fit every single diffrent headset out there. They worked great for mine but I need a new one and I noticed that only about half of the bluetooth headsets out there will fit these.,__label__2
Preset sizes just don't fit: The title says it all. Preset sizes of the EarGels just don't fit my ears. The tube that directs sound does not go in my ear canal far enough and the hook that is supposed to hold the unit in your ear will not hold it in mine. None of the 3 sizes of gels made a difference.Try before you buy if possible.,__label__1
"Didn't fit: Although good quality product, it doesn't fit my ear at all. None of the sizes fit comfortably or snug. I can't use it at all and just wasted my money.",__label__1
"Doesn't fit well at all, hard to get into ear.: I bought these to help with what I've read, to get the Jawbone to fit better. These ear pieces were hard to get into the ear no matter what size I tried. For a wireless earpiece you want to be able to get it on and off your ear quick if you need to, and these prevent you from doing so.",__label__1
"Not for my application: I was misled by a user review that indicated the gels would help my new Jawbone stay in my ear without the hook. The gels would stay in my ear but came off my headset, allowing it to fall to the ground. These may be OK but not for my application.",__label__1
"You only need 1 size: I cannot find where to buy my size and which ear I use my eargel. What in the world are you supposed to do with 3 sizes and 3 sides when you most likely will only use 1 size and 1 side??The product is comfortable and without the use of a boom mike makes this product number 1, except for being able to buy the right size eargel replacements.",__label__2
"Not a trustworthy company: I bought two sets of these. They're priced at $9.50. But, when they arrived, the price tag still stuck on the item says $2.99. Nice way to hide your ""shippign cost"" ($6.51) from your customers! This company goes on my ""Never Again"" list!",__label__1
"Junk plain and simple: great idea the issue is some people (me) dont have the ""flap"" that these fit into on my ear, the top piece needs to be at least 5mm longer to fit without falling out. the teacup ear bud works better.and since i opened it i cant return it way to go amazonif your ears dont have deep folds do not buy these.",__label__1
waste of money: Absolute waste of money. What arrived was knock off crap that smelt like petrol and was slightly greasy/slippery to the touch.I left them sitting outside their packaging for a month so see if they improved but all they did was make the area smell like them.Given the price and cost to return not worth the trouble to send back however I would never buy from these guys again.Am fairly surprised at the comments of quality etc - suggest people go and see what the real thing looks/feels/smells! like in a retail store.,__label__1
"didn't fit my ears: Complete waste of money. All three sizes pushed my Jawbone ICON out too far from my face to make contact with my jawbone.I know my ears stick out ... I am not dumbo though. This was a waste of money for me, thankfully they were only 10 bucks.I went back to the ear pads that came with the ICON... Is stays in for a while as long as i don't move... Not quite battlefield worthy as JB claims...",__label__1
"Way too large!: Well I took a chance on these. I read previous reviews and believed what they said...Always go with your first instincts. I should have known better. They looked too big in the pictures, but the reviews made it sound like only a tiny part of these ear gels actually went in your ear. So I took a chance on them.I was so disappointed. They come with three sizes, however even the smallest size is much bigger than the ear bud on the Jabra bluetooth device, which was the initial problem. Don't believe previous reviews that tell you that these will solve the problem, they make it worse.I now have the newest, most expensive Jabra bluetooth device that will not stay in my ear. When it is in correctly it is very painful. I am now going to purchase the earbuds that I thought sounded good before I read the reviews. I will update then.",__label__1
To Big: These were way to big for my ears. Even the small size was to large. I usually wear the medium size ear gel that comes with the BT device. I am using these on a Jabra Extreme 2 so maybe they were not made for that device. The gel did fit properly over the device however but I had to force it hard into my hear and it became pretty painful after a couple of hours of wear.,__label__1
excellent vendor: eargels replaced old and lost ones that came with my blue tooth. they fit well and got ere quicker than expected.,__label__2
Great for a few weeks: I purchased the eargels which was very comfortable and initally stable. Unforunately after a few weeks of infrequent use my ICON would fall out of the eargel and when stored away it invarable fell out and I would have to replace the ICON back into the eargel. So I have returned to using the original ICON rubber piece which although not as comfortable at least stayed in place.,__label__1
Not compatible with Jawbone Icon: With the rubber ring in place the head set does not seat well in the gels and comes out too easily. With the ring off it will barely stay in the small size. The medium gels fit me best until they are stretched by the rubber ring. One gel even split wen trying to put the earpiece back in. I am trying the small for now until I find a better solution.,__label__1
Terrible design: I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.,__label__1
Ear Gels: None of them actually fit my ear or the other person I brought them for. They were way too big. If you have small ears don't purchase this item.,__label__1
"JABRA GEL FOR EARPHONES: I was looking forward to some really comfortable gel inserts for my earphones. I thought these would fit the bill, but they don't by a long shot. To begin with, even the smallest size was far too big to fit my ears. The large looked gigantic. I cannot in good faith recommend these. If they develop ones that are sized appropriately, I might give them a try. I gave these to a couple of friends, and even they said there was no way these word work for them either. What more can I say? Stick with inserts from companies like Shure or Westone.",__label__1
Much needed: I bought these to go with the Jawbone 2 because the ear piece they use will not stay in your ear and the loops that go over your ear just does not fit.These are great and they set in your ear nicely.,__label__2
"Jabra Eargels Great Help for my Jawbone II: While I loved the sound of my Jawbone II headset, it would not remain secured with the eargels provided. These Jabra eargels work wonderfully and keep the headset comfortably and securely in my ear.",__label__2
"Solid upgrade for Jawbone: Bought these for my Aleph Jawbone IPROS: Fit right on, stays snug. Do not have to use the ear loop any more. Cheap. Isolates sound from background noise better than stock Jawbone earpieces.CONS: Ocassionally comes the headset when not in use or when I take it off my ear. Could not find one that fit my ear perfectly.BOTTOM LINE: A no-brainer upgrade for Jawbone users. Not a perfect solution but much better than what came with the Jawbone and its too cheap to not give it a try.",__label__2
"Not for me...: These probably work great for some people, but they didn't for me. None of the three sizes gave me just the right fit and I ended up going back to the factory gel that came with the device.",__label__1
Worthless: None of the gels came close to fitting in my ear - I ended up using the little rubber ring in the kit on my Jabra bluetooth to keep it from slipping out. Highly not recommended...,__label__1
"They do not honer their return policy and the product was not what I ordered.: DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sent me Jabra EarGels claiming they fit the Jawbone Prime 2. They did not. Because I had them for 28 days, they would not take them back. Their return policy stated that you can return up to 30 days.DO NOT BUY FROM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",__label__1
How is this supposed to work?: I got these for my jawbone headset. Many had said they work great. but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone.,__label__1
"Not Recommended: I only have one word to say about it...""NOT RECOMMENDED""...but still you can go ahead & waste your $ 10 to find out...Good Luck",__label__1
"So much better than ""over the ear"": I have been using in-ear bluetooth devices for a couple of years. My wife and daughter (of the small ear canal clan) had opted for over the ear designs because of fit and comfort issue. As it turned out, neither of them used their ear buds because of the loose/insecure fit and feel of the ear hanger design. The Jabra gels resolved that problem by 'sizing down' to match their diminutive ears . . . . It would be nice if you could order by specific size (s-m-l)and side (l-r) rather than getting the 'variety pack'.",__label__2
"Fits perfectly on my Jawbone headset: I'm using the largest of the 3 sizes of EarGels that came with the shipment and it works great on my Jawbone headset. Just pop the existing earpiece off the Jawbone, fit this on, and you're done. It's comfortable, easy to insert in my ear, and fits snugly which allows me to remove the badly designed ear clip that comes with the Jawbone. The sound is also much better than before.Clever little accessory and highly recommended.",__label__2
"bad fit, way too big: Only buy these if you have huge ears! Even the smallest ones were too big for my ears.Jabra EarGels - ClearI suppose in theory they should work to channel the sound into your ear, but that's only if the pieces fits into your ear, I didn't get a chance to test that aspect.",__label__1

"I can hear!: I got these for my Jawbone as the included earpieces were horrible. The ear gels actually made the Jawbone audible in noisy environments.

Does not fit jawbone 2 very well: I bought this based on the reviews that said that these will fit the jawbone 2 bluetooth headset. They did not fit very well and were very loose.

It would constantly slip off the jawbone earphone and would not stay attached.I now use the jawbone without an earbud. It doesn't fit as nicely, but it stays in my ear now.",__label__1

"Works well and comfortably.: I bought these to use on a Samsung WEP200 blu-tooth head set. The one I am using, works fine and fits the Samsung properly. It is much more comfortable than the thingy that came on the Samsung. I must say, it is a shame to buy something that comes in a pack of six and you can only utilize one or two out of six. It should be sold in multiple packs, all of the same size.",__label__2
"Instructions on how to use with Jawbone: If you take the ear bud off the Jawbone and try to attach the Jabra Eargels, they won't stay on very well. Instead, notice that the Jawbone comes with two round earbuds that appear to be identical. Tear the rubber shroud off one of them to expose the round plastic piece inside of it. Take this plastic piece and lock it onto the Jawbone (read user's manual). The Eargels will slip over this piece and hold quite firmly to the headset. Notice also that the Eargels have a square notch on the inside. Point the notch toward the back of the Jawbone. This will align the piece properly with the ear.The Eargels allow the Jawbone to be securely held in the ear without the annoyingly difficult earloop, but cause a little discomfort in my ear because I have to use the larger pieces. With the earloop, I can use the smallest piece and the Eargels are very comfortable.",__label__2
"I need two sizes!: I love these eargels. My ears are a funny shape and I can't wear regular earbuds, but when I add these gels, they fit great and don't fall out. They block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds. Sometimes I need a Small, and sometimes I need a Medium, depending on the day, the weather, and how long I use them. (I gave the Large size to my boss, and he loves them too, so don't say you can't use all of the sizes, guys.)",__label__2

I was having difficulty hearing and also getting a comfottable fit with the included ear hook that came with my Jabra JX-10 Series II Bluetooth headset. I removed the hook and attached one of the 6 gels that came in the pack to the headset and found that the volume increased 40% and I was able to achieve a comfortable fit. The headset is small enough and light enough that the gel holds the headset in the ear. I was about to give up on this headset (and all earhook type Bluetooth headsets) prior to getting the gels. If you are looking for a comfortable (and econimical) alternative for earhook type headsets, I strongly recommend that you give these a try. They are well worth the price.",__label__2

"These are not the answer to Jawbone Noise Asason: While Jawbone make a great blue tooth ear bud, it doesn't interface with ears well. The Jabra solution doesn't work. It doesn't hold the ear bud well allowing it to fall off at the most inconvieniant times. It also hurts your ear and is difficult to insert. It's not the answer, friends.",__label__1
"GREAT: The Jabra Eargels are wonderful.. I cannot believe how comfortable, and user friendly they are. Thank you, if not for these, I could not use my bluetooth.Great Merchandise..",__label__2
"These don't work with Jabra BT250v headsets: I'm not sure what they *do* work with exactly (and it'd be nice if there was some clue in the product description), but they don't fit these headsets.EDITED TO ADD: Actually, I just discovered a ""wireful"" non-Bluetooth Jabra thing that I had purchased years ago and forgotten. It plugs into a phone's headset jack, and these earpieces fit that fine.",__label__1
"Jabra clear gel - useless: These were said to work great with the Jawbone blue tooth headset. They don't, are almost impossible to put on and do not stay on the headset. I think they are useless for the Jawbone.",__label__1

"Ripoff ! Don't Buy From CMMA Accessories !: I received these and they were defective. Months later, the company has continued to dodge me and still has not processed my refund.

"Good solution for people with weird shaped ears.: All I have read about these was pretty much true. You can remove the rubber piece and press these over the part that it was attached to and they will stay, but they do come out with a little tug. A fine line of rubber cement will fix that though, and it peels off if necessary. But the great thing is that they will hold the Jabra in your ear without the ear loop. And that's huge, especially for someone like me with really weird shaped ears that nothing else [except an over the head headset] seemed to work. All in all worth the cost easily. I just wish you could order multiple pieces in one size only. If I lose the 1 that fist my ear I have to buy a 6 pack again just to get the one that I need.",__label__2
"Very functional, not very pretty: Like many others, I purchased the Jabra EarGels because I couldn't get myJawbone 2to stay securely in my ear. No mater which size earloop I tried, the Jawbone would flap against the side of my face as I walked. As a result, the 'noise assassin' sensor wouldn't touch my face, mitigating the benefit it should have had.Pros:+Jawbone now fits securely in my ear, even without the ear loop+Incredibly comfortable+Sound seems 'clearer' now that the speaker fits snugger in my ear and the noise assassin sensor touches my face.Cons:+The silicon isn't perfectly clear, and the yellowish tinge makes them look dirty+Much larger than I thought they would be - they're quite conspicuous.",__label__2

I knew this lady was a great cook, so I ordered it myself. I'm pretty picky about which cookbooks I keep. This one is very nice. I love all the seafood recipes. A classic.",__label__2
"Great effects...NO HEART NO PASSION: The special effects of this film were wonderful--no debate there--but Armand Assante seems like he's sleep-walking through this movie. It LOOSELY follows the poem at parts and suffers from a severe lack of passion! Compare this film with the 1950's ""Ulysses"", which despite poor effects, had MUCH more passionate and inspired portrayals of the characters by Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn among others. Even the classic scene involving Argos the dog was ommitted from this modern creation. Ugh!On the flip side, Athena's portrayal by Isabella Rossellini and the actor playing the god Mercury are very fun to watch in ""The Odyssesy"". Still...not enough to do the story justice.",__label__1
"Poor excuse for a great story: I watched this movie this year after I read the book. The movie switches the story a lot and the acting is very dissapointing- the actors of Odysseus, Penelope and Telemachus, the main parts are not very talented. I would show this to a child to give them a taste of the Odyssey, but if you have read the book or are planning to, watching this will ruin the flavor of the Odyssey.",__label__1
"Mythological Fiction: This film is one of the better of this genre--due to the casting, and the more ""true to life and literature"" approach that is taken. The characters seem much more ""human."" Enough sexual content, albeit well done, to preclude viewing by even teenagers. Homer's story is followed pretty faithfully, too, from my distant memories. But the real ""excellence"" is in the acting.",__label__2
"Oh boy... dont let this spoil your opinion of Homer: The origional creater of The Odyssey, Homer, did a wonderful job producing an action-packed story where you cared about the characters and made you eager to know what would happen next. Thousands of years later, when TVs are in existence, we fail at telling the same story with his exuberance. The motion picture depiction of Homer's work is a lame collection of attempted action scenes that does nothing to keep the watcher entertained throughout this movie. The human characters along with those mythical creatures they encounter respond to events without using common sense that anyone with half a brain would use. Despite all that, assuming the plot and the logic of the characters entertained you enough to keep your eyes open during the movie, you'd realize how all the actors seem undecided on what accent to use or even how to pronounce the names of the others...",__label__1
"absolutely HORRIBLE: I have never been so disgusted (or sickenly entertained) by a movie before. I am one of the few who have ACTUALLY read the ODYSSEY. I did like the poem. After reading it, I decided to watch the movie. There were almost NO accurate allusions at all to the poem. The characters' acting skills were that of an elementary school kids, and the scenes were obviously fake. I feel bad for Homer, he must be spinning in his grave. The fact that got 4 out of 5 stars is most appalling. I feel sorry for humanity as it is, believing such [nonsense] is the work of Homer.",__label__1
"Cmon ""honors"" people!: the movie was pretty bad, but i would think that honors kids would be original enough to write their own reviews. alice's was good, those were her words, but kayla, jana...we were all there when noteboom said what you wrote and you're taking credit for it? please!",__label__1
"Excellent, Exhilirating, and Fun: And great and entertaining film! A WONDERFUL GUEST CAST and some flavor to it, and is not racially discriminant(Vanessa Williams is in it), something we a lot these days.Armand Assante and his band of supporting actors give great life to the film and I notice the supporting actors are actually trying to make it better, rather than most actors who just do the role because it'll make them money. GREAT MOVIE, WORTH THE $13.00Now, you wonder, why did he give it four stars out of five if it is so good? The reason is this movie is very depressing at some parts and gets very gruff and there is and little crude comedy. Especially at the end. That plucks off a star, just because it was pretty bright and cheeful during the voyage. OVERALL A GREAT MOVIE AND YOU SHOULD REALLY CONSIDER BUYING IT, BUT THERE ARE HAPPIER FILMS.",__label__2
"Great translation from print to screen! Worth buying a copy: It was an accident that I chanced upon watching The Odyssey on the Hallmark Network. No viewing time not well-spent with the lavish production design, brilliant acting, and not-off-tangent-from-literature screenplay. I hope they release a DVD version right away.",__label__2
"WOW: Watching this movie after having read the book is pretty much hell. The fact that they changed the whole plot from the book makes it seem like a joke. Then the ""special effects"" just made it even worse. Even if you haven't read the book and you don't know the real story, the movie was still horribly directed and filmed. There are no transitions, and the actors don't seem to realize they are all in one movie together. They all have their own accents and the only thing they have in common with the characters they are playing from the book is their names. The only reason anyone should ever watch this movie is out of complete boredom and a need to make fun of something.",__label__1
"Uhh..... Were they stoned?: This was the biggest piece of drunken hoopla in the WORLD! I can't believe people would actually take time out of their daily schedule to watch this! If you actually read The Odyssey, the movie is NOTHING like the real thing. I STRONGLY suggest that you read the book first. Well, anyways, no one is going to read this review thus rendering this review useless and something to clutter the internet even more than it already is. I AM THE ANTICRHIST!",__label__1
"Uggh: Yes, yes the movie was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. N does when he watches Boston Public. But how bad it was is beside the point. Who really cares if some of the people in our class are writing Mr. N's ideas on here. If I were him, I would be flattered to know that people beleived strongly enough in my ideas to take the time to write about it on amazon.com. To everyone who wrote a review on this horrific movie, and didnt criticize other people's reviews, good for you. I hope in the future we can all express our disgust with this movie without having our competency as an honors student questioned by someone who won't even tell us who they are. But until then, Lizzie Mcguire is on (hehehe) so I must be going. I'll see you all periods 1/2. - Andrew",__label__1
"Mullets across the Med: I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney.",__label__1
"More like a NEGATIVE 3: This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!",__label__1
"I agree: I totally agree with andrew...and by the way, people who dont know any of us and dont really know whats going on...please dont waste your time with this movie...you're better off watching old reruns of whos the boss...even though im deprived of cable and wouldnt know...most of you probably know who this is",__label__1
coulda been betta!!!!!!!!: the special effects sucked and we've seen good special effects and the special effects in the odessy were crap and in comparison to a lot of movies we've seen it was pretty crap. it was realy BORING! (...) we've seen and weve seen heaps of them and some of them were realy gory over all COULDA BEEN BETTA!!!!!,__label__1
"Blech: This movie was the epitome of, well, everything wrong with movies. It took the premise of adapting Homer's literary classic and completely butchered it into this...osbstrocity. With acting that would pale in comparison to an elementary school play, a script that would make Ed Wood blush, and some of the words special effects ever, it truly makes me sad for humanity.The one good point is that it makes for some great ""in"" jokes. Telemakhos's double spear throw has become a running gag at my school.",__label__1
"Still compelling after 3000 years.: Homer would have endorsed this rendering of his tale. Full of wonderful special effects, gorgeous Mediterranean vistas, and gods and goddesses who look their parts, this movie is still driven by personalities. The casting was brilliant: Armand Asante is all that one could wish in an Odysseus -- engaging, passionate, mature, heroic in every dimension. Isabella Rosellini and Greta Saachi are perfect in their roles as Athena and Penelope, respectively. Telemachus is a classical adolescent only child, and Antichea, Odysseus's mother, dominates each of her scenes. While this production is eye-candy from beginning to end, the visual appeal cannot distract from the timeless humanity of its characters. There is a reason that Homer's story still reaches us after 3000 years, and this telling does justice to its ancient material.",__label__2
"adventurous. suspenseful. mythological.: The Odyssey was about the greek hero Odysseus' journey home from his victory of the trojan war. He encounters many perils on his voyage. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN FANTASY , THIS IS YOUR MOVIE.",__label__2
"kewl!: The movie the Odessey was a very very good movie. It was very well writen and acted out. I saw this movie during my History class at school. The actors did and axcellent job in acting out this movie. They made me feel like I was in the movie with them the whole time. My favorite god was Aeolus. He was very funny. Odysseus was played by Armand Assante. He was a very good actor. My favorite part in the whole movie is when Odysseus and Teemachus kill all of the kings that had come to marry Odysseus' wife, Penelope. The only thing wrong with the whole movie was the sexual content. There was no nudity but there were a few love seens. The special effects are awesome. But there are a few boring parts when the people were talking.",__label__2
"THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!: As a Detroit Red Wings fan, I must say that I loved this version of the Odyssey! This special effects were absolutly wonderful, and I must say I love the acting, some of the best i've ever seen in my life, almost better than sergey federov acting to get hit to draw a high sticking call! There was more action than Chelios misses checks! Oh, and there were more holes in this movie than Curtis Joseph leaves in his net. This movie was wodderful",__label__1
"Yeah, watching it felt like 10 years, too.: NBC miniseries tells the tale of the Greek hero Odysseus, played flatly by Armand Assante. Boring adventure film features unlikeable characters, routine action scenes, and a lack of spirit and passion. This all builds up to a surprisingly very bloody conclusion (Given its TV roots).* 1/2 out of *****",__label__1
"Ouch! This movie was so bad, it was funny: Everything about this movie was baaadddd....From the everchanging accents, the fake special effects(the cyclops looked so fake that it took away from the movie), the movie was so flawed that it became more entertaining to look for the flawed parts than actually watch the movie. Yeah, this movie sucked.",__label__1
"Odyssey (VHS): I needed this in a timely manner to replace the department video that had been misplaced. I ordered it the day before Thanksgiving, and it was shipped out to me the Friday after. It arrived in good condition in plenty of time for me to review before using it in the class room.",__label__2
"Agonizingly Long: Like reviewer Jueichi Shen who said it felt like it took him the length of the Odyssey itself to watch it, I thought this movie was agonizingly long at 3 hours and 38 minutes. I will never watch it again, so this one is headed for the public library and a status of tax deduction. Good special effects, though hence my 2-star rating.",__label__1
"Movie is awesome. Service comperable to Wal-Mart: I already know that I will love the movie. The problem is, shpping is and always has been a deceit. Even f you pay for next day (Prime Member), you will not get it on time. There is no other solution for law-abiding people.",__label__1
"The odyssey: I thought that the Odyssey was a very good movie.It was well put together, and had great acting.The effects of the movie were average.I especially enjoyed the scenes with the cyclops.Although its a very interesting movie I believe that it is too long, and the audience/viewers gets bored.In general I thought that it was a great movie that was educational, and was very succesful.By Josh 7R.",__label__2
"Reasonable interpretation of a classic: When you start with such good material, it's hard to please everyone. Like ""The Lord of the Rings"" many reviewers are disappointed that the movie didn't match their own visions of a great book. (Notice how no one ever complains that ""Goldfinger"" or other Bond movies are significantly different from the Ian Fleming novels?) Personally, I thought the re-telling to be convincing, I liked the way they kept the story moving (it IS trying to cover 20 years) and found the special effects ""good enough."" My kids have worn out the VHS tape and I'm buying a DVD because we enjoy the movie.Lastly, just a pet peeve for other reviewers who complained that Telemachus' double spear throw defied physics...HELLLO!!! last I checked, three headed monsters defied biology!..and that whole Hermes flying thing, totally bogus eh? People..this would be a FANTASY with GODS and GODDESSES, not the new BBC special ""Walking with Odysseus!"" Sheesh!",__label__2
"Good: I saw this movie for first time having missed it when it first aired. I thought the special effects were amazing and my favorite sequence was the cyclops. The scene where the ship goes over the edge was very amazing, after that the story just seemed to grind to a halt. Much to long and boring after the first hour and a half. But well worth the rental if you like special effects.",__label__2
"Great book; terrible movie: if you have read and liked the book, or know anything about the story, this movie would certainly want to make you want to kill yourself. odysseus is portraid as rugged, stupid barbarian who is nothing like the hero Homer described him as. the special effects aren't too uplifting either, although it was a pretty low budget film. all of the events in the movie are nothing like in the book; it was as thought the writer's had never even read it!!! bad acting, cheesy special effects, and a completely inaccurate plot make Hallmark's version of the odyssey one of the worst movies to ever come out of a classic novel. in conclusion, i'd rather go to Hades than watch this movie!",__label__1
"Homer's enchanting tale: Homer's enchanting tale is brought to life in ""The Odyssey.""I, a student, first saw this movie while studying Ancient Greece with my class. On the first day of Ancient Greece, my teacher popped the video in the VCR and made us take catagorized notes.Since it was our first day we had no idea about Greece's history, gods and goddesses, heroes or political science.However, the Odyssey told my class and I a great deal about Greece.One of the reasons why I reccommend this movie, is your (or your child, for that matter) don't know too much on Ancient Greece, you put the movie in the VCR, and 2 hours done with the credits rolling, you will know so much about Ancient Greece.It occured to me that in this movie The Odyssey about Odysseus leaving Ithaca for the Trojan war and fight the curse of Poseidon, underneath it all there is the political science and the goddesses and gods history and way of life and the scenery.Over all this is an amazing movie.",__label__2
"Great for the classroom: This video is great to use as a resource for teaching The Odyssey. The students find the video entertaining and helpful. However, the movie does not exactly follow the original Odyssey. Of course, the directors took some creative liberty on certain scenes. On the whole, the movie does a great job in giving students an account of the journey of Odysseus.",__label__2
"Good: I loved this movie! The special effects were great and Armand Assante did a great job acting the part of Odysseus. My daughter even sat down and watched it with me, which doesn't happen very often. However, I loved it as a movie, not necessarily as an adaptation of The Odyssey, which is one of my favorite books.",__label__2
"NOT a good representation of Homer: I teach The Odyssey, and let me tell you, this movie does NOT reflect the book well, if you're watching it for testing purposes (and I know you are!) However, I DO show selected scenes (out of sequence because the movie is out of sequence) just because my students think it's fun. WHEN will a GOOD version be made??? I had such hopes for Troy, and meh....My students' favorite part is the inexplicable arm action of the guard who announces ""Tele-machos of Ithaka!"" Scenery WILL be chewed - even the usually OK Greta Scacci comes off rather poorly.",__label__1

"OMG! worst movie ever!: haha . . . wow this is one of those movies that is so completly bad that its funny. ok 1st of all Odysseus accent changes in almost every scene. 2nd penelope pronounces telemachos different than Odysseus. 3rd telemachos sounds like a whiney english boy. 4th posiedon ""the god of the wine dark sea"" is a face in a wave. 5th anitkleia is just freaky. 6th Odysseus beard changes color. 7th the cow scene wasnt even in there. 8th THEY NEVER LET PENELOPE HAVE HER REVENGE! 9th telemachos cant do any thing but then amazingly he can throw 2 spears at once. 10th Aoilos sounds like a cartoon. 11th the characters are all supposed to be bueatiful but they are all ugly . . . and i can go on. NOTEBOOMS 1/2 ROX! haha SPACE NEEDLE!",__label__1
"Lord, have mercy!: If this movie were worse (and if it COULD be) there would undoubtedly be an unhealthy number of premature deaths .... First of all, there's Poseidon. This CG bill shut is an outrage to humanity. His rolling waveface accompanied by Assanti's pitiful attempt to weep provides an outstanding performance which may (being optimistic) top the emotion found in a dramatic episode of Mr. Rogers. I am certain that if poor old (really old) Homer were given a second life to live in this century, he would probably waste it by inflicting himself with chimera. With all due respect, though none is due, this film is pathetic. That's all I have to say. Just DON'T watch this movie before (or even after) you read the book, unless you wish to perish at an unnaturally early stage in life!!!!!!!!GOODBYE!!!!!!!!",__label__1
"Awful, just awful: Armand Assante is one of the worst actors I have ever had the misfortune to watch. He could not act dead if you put a bullet in his brain. The odyssey is a great story and it deserves a great actor. I would rate this movie zero stars if I had the option.",__label__1
"Who be dissin on our noteboom?: Ok, first of all Mr.Cmndrnineveh from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA I find it very hard to believe that you even read the full book version of THE ODYSSEY.

Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book. To the point where Telemachous was whiny and horrible; Athena had blue eyes; and Menelaos' hair is black. All i gotta say is what a waste of film! Ppl out there- spare yourself.",__label__1
"Falwed but Fun none the less: I love Greek History and mythology. When I heard a mini-series of the Odyssey was being created I was anxious for two reasons; I was dying to see it and was terrified of how badly it was going to be butchered. This was a delightful surprise.To my amazement the writers took some minor literary license with the story but all in all it worked. What is even better...it was a lot of fun to watch. I would recommend that anyone thinking about buying this do so... but also buy the book. Turn your brain off watch the movie, engage the brain again and read the original story. Either way you are promised a good time.",__label__2

Schure (who was friends with the composer Richard Wagner) was one of Steiner's greatest admirers, and vice versa, and interestingly enough Schure was the one to introduce Steiner to his future wife Marie von Sivers!This play by Schure is really a monument to all ancient Drama and heralds in the new Dramatic form taken up by Rudolf Steiner.

"Bait & Switch - Completely misleading picture: I too got taken in by the ""coiled"" picture. I got a curly cable, not the straight cable pictured ""in a coil."" Completely misleading, I lost my $3.99 that I paid for next day shipping from Prime as well! Total bait & switch. I didn't read the one review on it. Now there are two. This cable is actually about 2 feet long with the coil.",__label__1

"rated comparatively with Wilbur's others: i have read all of Wilbur's books and found that one learns a lot about Africa (with a few exceptions). you learn african history, economics, social problems, environmental problems, natural history, etc. in this one, you learn about the diamond industry and the history of the Namibian diamond coasts, while Wilbur weaves it into his ""unputdownable"" story. kind of like the Master of the Game with substance. for an even better look at Namibian history, try the Burning Shore.",__label__2
"The Diamond Hunters: This book is one of Wilbur Smith's early books and it shows.After reading his books set in ancient Egypt, I bought this thinking it would be a good read. He spent too much time on the relationships and too little time on the meat of the story which should have been the search for the elusive diamonds. I was able to finish it but was very disappointed particularly with the ending. It was as if he ran out of steam or got into a hurry. The ending in the book just left you wishing that he would have given you a little more to tie up the loose ends. Not a bad book but, not a great one either.",__label__1
The Diamond Hunters: Terminally boring and predictable but was able to finish it. I would rate his Monsoon and the early Courtney triliogy as 4-5 stars.,__label__1
"The Diamaond Hunters: When I order a book I expect a Book 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. I would send it back but it would cost more than the imitation is worth.",__label__1
Totally Unbelievable Tale: This book falls in the bottom five of the 28 books that I have read by Wilbur Smith. There is no review of the African continent that is so prevalent in his other books. No intermingling of the diverse peoples that populate this country that you find in most of these books. Here there is nothing here but greed and sex without purpose and typical family squabbles.To my knowledge diamond mining has never been done in this fashion in Africa.,__label__1
"Less than Smith is capable of doing.: Wilbur Smith is my favorite author, but I was disappointed in this book. It appeared to be written hastily and without the wonderful descriptive phrases he normally uses to paint his stories background. Never the less I still read it cover to cover.",__label__2
Love Wilbur Smith: What a great writer. Wilbur Smith could write about wallpaper and I would find it interesting. I just wish more of his books were available on Kindle since I will no longer by a paperback....,__label__2
Poorly Made: What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead,__label__1
"Dangerous Mail Service: So often we see in westerns the stagecoach roaring into town and well-dressed easterners get out--not even dusty. This book shows the real and extremely difficult days of the stagecoach mail delivery and does it in a very factual, well-documented way. The end of the book should have been put at the first so we could know Ben Holladay before we learned all about the difficulties of getting the people and the mail to the western cities. It was especially interesting to me since my father and brother have the same name--Ben Holladay. He may be a distant relative and we would be proud to claim him.",__label__2

In good condition: Always nervous about purchasing a VHS tape ...but wanted to see this version of the movie and it was the only format in which I found this version available. In exactly the condition as advertised. Played perfectly.,__label__2
"I was rooting for the whale in this one: Having seen both versions, the first with Peck as Ahab, I would have to lean towards the original. The new version with Patrick Stewart had it's moments, but Peck as Father Maple looked like he was in a daze and didn't know where he was (or who he was) Peck's performance was rather disturbing. The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout ""ENGAGE"" rather than ""THERE SHE BLOWS"".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text. This new version had far too many added bits for the purist. If you enjoy remakes, (I don't know why) then go for it. If you are a stickler for detail, pass it",__label__1
1956 beats 1998 by several nautical miles: So disappointing! How could a movie made 40 years later be so much worse than the original? Patrick Stewart was great as Ahab but that's where the compliments end. The rest of the characters are played by rank amateurs or completely miscast. The whaling scenes are worse than the original ones and the ice-breaking scene was almost comical. I was glad to see the actors put out of their misery at the end.,__label__1
"Why is Fedellah Asian?: I love the book, Moby Dick. Yes, that does make me a freak of nature.One of my favorite characters is Ahab's harpooner/attendant demon Fedellah who was completely ignored in the John Huston/Ray Bradbury movie version, but, alas and alack, this Fedellah not only does not have a great white mane worn like a turban on his ""Persian"" head in this movie but he is a bald Asian with a Fu Man Chu mustache.I know. Picky, picky, picky. And Flask has a pipe not Stubb. Alas. Still, it has fairly wonderful production values and if you don't have a Fedellah fetish, you'll probably like this one. Queequeg rocks.",__label__2
"Overall, an excellent movie.: I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Not having read Melville's book, this movie gave me much more of an understanding of Ahab and his tortured soul than the Gregory Peck version. Excellent acting by Stewart and the rest of the cast. My only complaint is with Moby Dick himself - the rubber whale used in the scenes is not very convincing.",__label__2
"Highly entertaining: I guess I'm in the minority, but I enjoyed this production quite a bit and highly recommend it. Patrick Stewart makes a terrific Captain Ahab, seething with a personal obsession with the white whale, and the rest of the cast is quite good, too. The film is faithful to the book and the production values are excellent. Highly entertaining.",__label__2
"A pitiful excuse for a movie: If you want to see a movie of Moby Dick, see the John Huston directed version, with screenplay by Ray Bradbury. This pitiful excuse for a movie was made by people who had no knowledge of New England, whaling, whales, or Herman Melville's epic novel. The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill ""Moby Dick"" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's ""BLAH!"" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale.",__label__1
"Moby Dick: Movie was great but the sub-titles were ""off"" and distracting (but hilarious at times!) Just finished reading the book, and the movie was pretty acurate. Anything with Patrick Stewart is ""quality"" in my book and I wasn't disappointed here. It was great to include Gregory Peck, also, and liked the special features with him after the movie.",__label__2
"Patrick Stewart and the 7 Dwarfs: Boy, what a lousy Moby Dick! Patrick Stewart is terrific. That is it, period. The effects with the whale are fine, but when the cabin boy is drowning, the water is only up to his chest. When will the REAL Moby Dick be on DVD? Now that the Coen Brothers have paid tribute with the ending of ""Oh Brother"", one can get one's hopes up again. Save your money for that.",__label__1
"Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!: Dont bother with this crap! It is one of the worst if not the worst! Movies that I have ever seen! It has bad acting,story and it is so so boring! I dont understand the point of this movie! TERRIBLE! DONT BOTHER!",__label__1
"TERRIBLE MOVIE: What a waste of 2 hours. Nothing gets accomplished at all! You watch some terrible graphics, watch everyone die, and they didn't even kill the freaking WHALE!That made me mad.This film accomplishes nothing.There is no point at all to this movie.Don't waste your time, money, and energy.Leave, quickly!",__label__1
"awesome: I thought Patrick Stewart did a fantastic job. He showed great feeling towards ""The great white whale"". I have seen this movie 3 times and I still enjoy watching it. It was much better than I was expecting. I wish this movie had been around years ago when I had to read the book in school, it would have given me a better perspective of it. also it would have made the book easier to read. I loved the movie!",__label__2
"Classics never die!: If your looking for a different version of the classic ""Moby Dick"" then fine. Personally I thought it fell short of the mark. The only highlight for me was when Gregory Peck made his apperance as the preacher. The original is still the one and only.",__label__1
"Simply awful: I know its very hard to bring a book like Moby-Dick to the screen, but at least John Houston tried in the 1950's. This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical ""savage"" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess.",__label__1
"Round Perditions Flames: I though this was a great film mainly because of the acting, Patrick Stewart, best known as Captain Picard from Star Trek the Next Generation, fits the Character of Ahab perfectly. Though the film looses a star for the quite dodgy special effects, Herman Mellville's story and A cast of great actors lift it up into a classic.",__label__2
Weak remake: I found this recent remake of the classic very weak. Stewart's potrayal of Ahab didn't have any of the power of Gregory Peck's 1956 character.The camera work was also terrible. Land is clearly seen in several scenes where the men are supposedly many months out to sea.,__label__1
"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS FILM,SEE THE HOUSTON 1956 ONE!: Between lousy directing, and pointless wide camera angles, and a total disreagard to the book, (Unlike previous film and TV episodics) this was so bad, that I forced myself to sit through the entire video, just to see if it ever got better, or resembled the book in any way. I don't think anyone read the book on this production, or even bothered to read the cliff notes. A real waste of the actor's time, and ours.",__label__1
"DRASTIC EDITS RUIN THE VHS VERSION: It seems that there are several different versions of this TV movie available. Rumor has it that the movie that was originally broadcast on USA came in at 3 hours, there is a laser disc version of the movie that is 145 minutes long, and the VHS version is 120 minutes long. Unfortunately, the edits made to the VHS version are so extreme, abrupt, and awkward that it makes the movie virtually unwatchable. You can't help but feel that you're missing something.",__label__1
strong smell of oil: This heater was used in a playroom in the basement. I loved the wheels because I could easily put it away when the kids were in the room. But the smell of oil was so strong I decided to return it. I called DeLonghi customer service and they told me any oil filled heater will smell like oil - especially when in the MAX setting.,__label__1
"Favorably impressed!: This little heater works far better than I'd hoped. I tested it in my toughest space, the 10 x 40 glassed front porch. For three nights, the outside temp was right at 27. The radiator on its highest setting kept the porch temp at 60! In other, smaller, rooms getting a cozy heat is no big deal. The only noise it makes is an occasional (low) click. I'd have given it five stars if the dial were easier to read, and it had a handle on both sides instead of one.",__label__2
"Long term owner: Had this for 3 years. It isn't much to look at, doesn't heat as strong as Delonghi TRD0715T i own. But worst of all it started to leek on the second year. ..Not recommended..",__label__1
"good heat, cheap wheels: I bought this from a local retailer for only $30 (less than 1/2 of the Amazon price). While assembling the wheels, one literally shattered in my hands. I brought it back for a new one and the same thing happened. The third one assembled fine, and the store gave me 3 spare wheels, just in case. I don't know if I would have shipped two of them back to Amazon.It throws quite a bit of heat for such a small unit. We bought this to replace an older radiator of the same design and the difference is striking. I also noted a bit of an oil smell, but that went away after a few uses. All in all, a good heater, but",__label__2
"Poor Product: This product is useful, I guess, if you have a very small enclosed area to heat, as it gives off only a very modest amount of heat even when set as high as it goes. It is not, as advertised, cheap to run. In fact it cost me as much as the gas bill for my entire apartment without reducing that gas bill more than a couple of dollars. It is made on the cheap. The plug doesn't even have a ground pole. I inadvertently bumped into it one day causing it to pull against the wall plug and fried both the wall plug and the heater's plug. I haven't used either since. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this product. I suggest you save yours.",__label__1

"excellent book: In my opinion is one of the best introductory book in statistical thermodynamics. As a matter of fact, there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic, but T.L. Hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way. In particular, I found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions (Part III). The last part is devoted to quantum statistics, it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening.",__label__2
"A nice companion to McQuarrie's text: I thought this was a terriable book by itself, but makes for a nice companion when reading through McQuarrie's book. McQuarrie skimps out on some of the explanations and instead leaves it to the reader to figure it out for themselves by solving his problems at the end of the chapter. One can usually find the answers (or at least some hints) within this book.",__label__1
"No better place to start with Stat Mech: If you are intrested with studing statistical mechanics then start here. Hill starts from the defintions and postulates of thermodynamics and then moves into applications and problems. You will need to understand Diff EQ for this book.The first chapter took me a week to read and work out the math but then I red the rest in 4 weeks. It is a hard start because Hill develops your background before starting with applications of the theory. I really began to grasp the subject after reading this book. Ohter books will not lay the mathout as well as Hill does. It is a hard read because Hill is so thorough, but the rewasd is well worth the struggle. It is a great introduction and I suggest all of Hill's Stat mech book. Another great bargin from DOVER PRESS.At the price I recomend it to all graduate chemical engineers and chemists",__label__2

"Dreadful.: Ms. Perry's depiction of post-traumatic head injury is completely irresponsible. She apparently did no research at all. Amnesia of the type she describes here does not exist. Thus, the underlying premise of this book unbelievable, even infuriating, to anyone with the most basic knowledge of brain injury. In addition to this, Monk's investigative skills are virtually nonexistent. His interviews with informants and suspects are fragmentary and incomplete. Suspense is not built, action is nearly absent, and the eventual solution is anticlimactic. Laden with turgid prose, this book is absolutely dreadful.",__label__1
"A disappointment: Having heard the author speak on the radio, her works praised highly by the host, I decided to start with the first of the Monk series. Unfortunately, I found the main character thoroughly unsympathetic and unlikable. The story was slow as molasses with bits and pieces of useless information thrown in to fatten the book. Also, I don't know the clinical features of amnesia, but it seemed that Monk's memory loss was selective and inconsistent. The ending was highly anti-climactic and the fate of the characters in question never revealed. I was very much looking forward to reading her books, but was sorely disappointed.",__label__1
"Not my cup of tea: This was the first Anne Perry book I have read, but it will be the last. I found the basic premise of the main character's amnesia to be a gimmick. It irritated me that he would never ""come clean"" about his lack of memory, especially when we find out that the people he worked with could see through it. I have enjoyed other murder-mysteries where the villain was a lot less obvious to the reader. It seems from her sales figures that I am in the minority - what am I missing?",__label__1
"Perry is now two times as classy!: William Monk awakens in a Victorian-era London hospital with amnesia. Over the course of this book, he returns to his job as a policeman, hoping that work will help him regain his memory as well as his detecting skills. What's fascinating is that not all he discovers about his life before the accident is flattering--including the fact that he may very well have been responsible for a serious crime. Over the course of Perry's new series--this book being the debut--Monk's past will at various times haunt, delight, and maybe even endanger him, and the people who come to be his allies don't always like him, but their loyalties to one another shine through. As with the Pitt mysteries, Anne Perry's trademark detail and eye-opening descriptions of what Victorian life was really like make this an entertaining way to read away a winter afternoon",__label__2
"This was the slowest and most non-action, action movie ever.: To start off, this movie lacks any direction, also there is no build up of excitment, no rising interest, and little or no action till the very end.

"Van Damme gives the best performance,: which does not bode well for the movie. The other actors are just so horrible and the story so flat. Don't get me wrong, I like Jean-Claude, movies like Timecop and Bloodsport were pretty good for what they were. The fighting scenes in Black Eagle just don't make up for a lame movie though.",__label__1
"worst action movie ever: Totally fake, unrealistic, plotless. I love action movies, but this one just didn't have any action in it. You could see the missed punches and fake reactions--I can't believe that anyone would pay money for this movie",__label__1
"Van Damme's a Bad Guy ?: I would say the plot is good, but the action and fighting scenes are not in favour for action-movie goers.",__label__1
"Where did the producers put all the money in Black Eagle?: First of all, as a Van Damme fan, this movie is definately one to see (if you must seek joy in seeing van damme die) for die hard van damme fans and that who hate him. For me, the movie feels like a Columbo epidose (the dramatic music) but the film is average, showing few plot, fight scenes or action. The biggest action scene is an explosion of a small wooden boat and a chase scene with cars going as fast as 25 mph! Plus the dvd features are limited and there is NO ""Making of..."" feature, only a theatrical trailer and some production notes (too short). Could have done with more DVD features for a region code free DVD.",__label__1
Seems every time Van Damme plays a bad guy he does his mute method acting: Black Eagle was released a few months after Van Damme became a star with Bloodsport. The film could have made Van Damme a wash up but luckily it didn't. The martial arts chorography in the film is very sloppy and the fight scene between Sho Khogusi and Van Damme is weak. Skip this one,__label__1
"I wish I could give 0 stars: I must admit that I'm not a big Van Damme fan. Still, I try to keep an open mind. Not only was the sound terrible, but it was so obvious that the punches were checked, that it would have made a comedy if the plot weren't so boring. I think that Woody Allen could make a better action picture than this attempt.",__label__1

"Didn't work...I have to start again: My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: ""One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months."" I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!",__label__1
"Flea control: This is a great product and I have used it for years. It is a part of flea control and should not be expected to be the one answer for every flea. Pets need to have flea medicine/baths as well as continuous vacuuming of the house since fleas can live on pet hair. A flea cycle is 21 days-using this product in a combination with proper flea control is the best way to get the maximum performance. Spray where pet sleeps, all carpets, furniture, area rugs, and fabrics where fleas can lay eggs. Keep it up once a week or more for the first 3 weeks to break the flea cycle while applying flea medication to your pets. Humans can carry fleas into the house as well as pets. The trick is to stay on top of the flea cycle so it doesn't become out of hand. If it is allowed to go through a few cycles without proper flea control, it will take much more effort, time, and products to get it under control.",__label__2

I returned after a few hours, opened the widows and started up the air conditioners and picked up the dog. The next day I noticed several adult fleas, though they were sluggish. I thought..great! Then the family started getting bites and seeing small and adult fleas. I feel I wasted my money for a product that seemed to give us 24hrs of relief.

Is airline approved. My husband has not has a chance to take it on a plane yet so not known how it would stand up, but my 1 1/2 yr. old twins liked to knock it over and stand on it a lot when it was within their reach. So I think it would hold up well for air travel if it could stand 2 kids without damaging the bow inside. Very good case for the cheap price.",__label__2

And you have to put in the arrow holders when they should be able to put that together at the factory.Pros-Easy to take, compact, lightweight, holds arrows, holds everything you need, big enough, not too small, good foam padding.OVERALL it's a really nice case especially for the money. i would buy this case 1,000,000 times again. everything is great. the only not so good thing is the construction. it's nice. don't get me wrong. but it's a little flimsy.",__label__2

Although the tracks on this CD are clearly Latin in influence & style, on a musical spectrum I would put the music on this disc somewhat closer to the Salsoul sound than I would to Fania All-Stars disco-era salsa music.",__label__2
"Not quite Gone with the Wind.: It was interesting to read The Foxes of Harrow again, as a ""senior citizen, since I was only in my early teens the first time I read...and enjoyed...the book. It is quite sensual, considering the year it was written. It has held up fine during the years. I probably understood the nuances better as an adult than as a teenager. Frank Yerby was a brilliant writer, and in this book he presents a balanced view of what white slave owners and their slaves faced during that pre-civil war era. I couldn't help comparing it with Gone With the Wind as I read it.",__label__2
"Wonderful!: I first read this book in 1962. Today, I can remember the characters as if I had read the book yesterday. A beautiful love story written in a gentler time. A story that will tear at your heart and conscience. Very moving!",__label__2
"inside not as good as the cover: The cover of this book makes the masks look intricate and impressive. On the inside, they look cartoonish. For a Halloween costume, I had more success by blowing up photos of Noh masks on a photocopier and then cutting out the eyes.",__label__1
"A book that long? Are you kidding me?: Yep, that was my reaction when I first heard of the girth of this book. I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'. Not only a good read but it has put any follow on's into the top portion of my must buy list.",__label__2
"Weak: This book was disappointing. It has too many major characters that are inadequately developed and too many plot lines to follow. The magic is an awkward add-in that the book could well have been written without.The first half of the book's plot, several of the characters, and the setting closely resemble one of C. J. Cherryh's Merovingian Nights stories, which was much better.",__label__1
"Sad: Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help.",__label__1
"It drags: I tried a couple of times to read this book. Each time I stopped half way through. It dragged in places and was OK in others, but it's definately not up to Mercedes' usual standard. The book finally wound up in the ""donate to the library"" pile.",__label__1
"Mercedes wrote this?: I've been a longtime fan of Mercedes and own most of her Valdemar series. So, of course, I picked this book up at my local store. After wrestling through 50 pages, I gave up! I plan to sell it back to my local store ASAP- this is nothing better than a paperweight in my bookshelves. The worst part is, my boyfriend picked it up and tried reading it. Now he thinks that this is a good example of her work!",__label__1
"Dishonest!: A large part of this book has been cannibalized from an earlier series, Merovingen Nights, a shared world based on a novel by C.J Cherryh (Angel with the Sword). This fact is mentioned nowhere in the book or cover and no credit to C.J. Cherryh is given for the concept.This book is a pale imitation of the original sections of the series that Lackey wrote. In my opinion some of the best writing Lackey has done are in the original series. Unfortunately, the series was never completed and the books are now out of print. I find it sad that Lackey has to resort to presenting previously written work as new. Clearly, she has run out of original ideas and her best works are behind her.",__label__1
"Alternate Italian Renaissance Light History: Any book set in the Renaissance is pretty much bound to be a complex amalgam of plots and counter plots. This book lives up to its setting in history. I was cautious in approaching a book that was written by three authors, expecting writing dissonance and perhaps some plot danglies. But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot. I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age. This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention. Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts. The plot is woven well enough and moves fast enough that deep characterization isn't missed. Well done entertainment.",__label__2
"JUST GREAT: So it was long, and it was a slow read, big DEAL. Ms Lackey and cohorts have spun a gripping, involved tale of GREAT characters, involved PLOTTING and lots of FUN. I read for pleasure and this was a pleasure. I was always looking back to keep things straight, but it was FUN. I lost most of two nights sleep because I couldn't put it down. This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer. Yours friends and family will think you have run away, and you have, To Venice, where you can spend a ripping vacation in you mind. The lady has won me back.",__label__2
"Ok at best: I didn't make it half way through the book before I gave up on it. It just seemed to go on and on and on.... I usually like Mercedes Lackey, but every once in a while, she makes a bobble, and this was one of them. I think the book whould have been a lot better as either two books or one greatly pared down book.",__label__1
"This book has already been written: Mercedes Lackey contributed to a series I'll refer to as the Merovingian Nights Series, set in a universe invented by C.J. Cherryh. Mercedes's ORIGINAL contribution to the Merovingian Nights series is a far better read. The Shadow of the Lion was a major disappointment to me, not to mention I could have spent my money more wisely on another book. There should have been a warning posted on the cover or flap that if the reader has read the Merovingian Nights series, this book will offer very few surprises. Shame on you Ms. Lackey!",__label__1
Too many cooks: The book had a plot line that meandered like a dog in a fire hydrant warehouse. The characters were as flat as the paper they were writen on. The authors collaboration worked as well as a mixture of a heavy smoker in a fireworks factory. It is very obvious it is a collaboration and it needs the hand of a better editor. If I had bought the book instead getting it at the library I would be demanding my money back for getting such a good example of why popular fiction is looked down upon. 1 star is being generous. I enjoyed other works by the authors and am severly disapointed in this collaboration.,__label__1
"This is Merovingian Nights ,not a new book: mergovian nights was the original series this muddled piece of work is based on. entire chapters and plots are lifted from those books, its unreal.the original books are much better, the loss of Retribution Jones, turning her into a minor wimpy character, was a great loss of a strong voice. i found most of the characters a poor imitation of the original series.having been to venice, i can state this book did not take me there, i had trouble belivieng it was venice, not paris.M lackey has written some fine books, why she put her name on this is a mystery.",__label__1
"Fantastic!: Fantastic book! I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end! This book is definitely going to be the start of an excellent series. The novel is based back in Venice, just around the decline of the Byzantium era. My favorite characters were without a doubt Manfred and Erik.This book is an excellent buy!",__label__2
"Tells of a Venice where magic is alive: Mercedes Lackey, Eric Flint & Dave Freer's Shadow Of The Lion is set in 1537 and tells of a Venice where magic is alive and two vagabond brothers are posed to influence its changes. A monster has been loosed on the city; and it's up to an unlikely band of individuals to join in defeating the danger.",__label__2
"an OK read, but not what I expected: I am a devoted fan of Mercedes Lackey, and I have read nearly all her books, and this book is by far, my LEAST favorite. i was tempted to quit half-way through, but i didnt, which helped, because alot of things that seemed completely irrelevant, made sense at the very end. the main problem with the story is that there are WAY too many characters, as in a hundred, its hard to keep track & even care about all of them. It has alot of plot & story, and it can be difficult to keep track of at times. Its not a BAD read, its just... very busy, with many many many characters. It was an OK read, but not what I expected.",__label__1
"Wonderful book: I love this book, it has different kinds of projects that you'll enjoy, and the charts are neat, I love it!!!!!!",__label__2
"Disappointing: Over the years I've bought several Dionne Warwick albums that I've listened to with great enjoyment. I find this particular excursion, however, a sad disappointment. It just doesn't work. The instrumentals almost seem like parodies of Vegas back-up arrangements. Miss Warwick sounds as if she is out of her element. And the sound quality is mediocre. Ms. Warwick is a singer that I respect and admire. But this particular album does little to burnish her legacy.",__label__1
"Unheard talent: Being a huge fan of Green Carnation and Agalloch, I decided to pick up this album and their ""Heart Of The Ages"" album at the same time. Honestly, this album seems like exactly what you would get when you cross those two bands. Impressed? Yes, overall this album was pretty awesome. The dark atmosphere was perfectly created. The female vocals in my opinion were better than the male vocals. A five star review is out of the question because the male vocals in fact were not very impressive at all. At times, I was so impressed with the background elements that I just wished the male vocals would just stop. Overall though, this album was a great purchase and is a must have for any fans of Agalloch, Green Carnation, or Katatonia.",__label__2
"Keeping Irelands History Alive Through Song: This CD captures the essence of how the Irish Soldier, during the War Between The States, passed on their history from Ireland. Prison Ships is an EXCELLENT song telling us how the Irish were persecuted and sent far from their homes to Australia. This is a great original effort along with Soldier Boys, Angelus Bells, Welcome, and the title track Rock of Erin. I think the 69th Pa did a superb job with their first effort. ALL proceeds go towards Civil War Battlefield Preservation and Educational Projects that the 69th Pa are well known. This CD is a pleasant change from the other Civil War CDs available. If you like traditional Irish Music, this one is a MUST. Keep up the good work.",__label__2
"A couple of positives. . .: . . .but not nearly enough to counter the negatives.First the positives:1) Some brilliant photography. One just can't get around this.2) Some truly likeable characters and character development -- especially several of the minor characters.There! That is two stars worth!Negatives:1) Spotty directing, which offsets the quality of the photography2) No earthly resemblance at all to the (true) book from which the story is supposed to have been taken3) A boring, and over-the-top gay agenda (along with any one of a number of similar ""far-left"" issues, poorly cobbled together4) A view of the Virgin Mary, which, while not openly portrayed offensively in the film, is bound, nonetheless to offendIn short, the bad outweighs the good. Skip this one.",__label__1
"This is a bad one: This is a really bad movie. The characters are one dimensional, the acting is sluggish, the dialogue is banal and contrived, the directing is awful, but worst of all, the script is terrible. The screenplay oozes simplistic simple minded notions of political correctness and insight where there is none. Audrey Wells purports to have written a complex and surprising story with unexpected twists and turns, but what she has produced is a shallow and unsatisfying film with no real purpose other than to make the fairly obvious point that life is full of surprises and unexpected outcomes. Gee - what an insight. The characters are completely unsympathetic and the only thing that makes this film watchable at all is the backdrop of Cortona. This film entirely misses the point of the book and I just hope the author was well paid for allowing her book to be associated with this awful movie.",__label__1
Terrible: Typical Hollywood movie trying to push off moral values that the average american does not believe in. This movie is slow and does not even make much sense at all. Hopefully most people do not live like this and if they do they would be considered weird.Do not waste your time with this movie!,__label__1
Under the tuscan sun: to be honest I expected a little more from the movie. it was too mellow and somewhat boring.,__label__1
"leave your seat and hop a plane!!!: I saw this movie at a sneak preview and will see it again when it comes out just because I know a few people who need to see this movie. This movie is a tune-up for the soul. If anyone has been down on thier luck or not so lucky in love this movie will pour some sweetness into that bitter place. I laughed, I cried several times this movie evoked that youthful part inside me that needs to be awakened every so often. With the beautiful cinematography and portrayal of the people you want to leave your seat and hop a plane for Tuscany. I heard so many people saying that as they left the theatre. Go see this movie and laugh and cry all at the same time.",__label__2
"A great idea!: Hey gang, let's pool our resources and get the rights so Mystery Science Theater can talk us through this one!I'm telling you it would surpass even Manos, Hands of Fate for sheer yuks. The cheese, the schmatz, the dishonesty, the cluelessness, the pretention of this flick just begs, begs to be put out of its misery.",__label__1
Stinks: This movie was terrible. If there was an option for - stars I would go there.Read the book it's much more entertaining!,__label__1
"Disappointing: Having read Under the Tuscan Sun three times, this movie was very disappointing in the way that a beautiful story became a run of the mill chick flick. As beautiful as the scenery was, the movie made Tuscany lose it's charm and warmth that I received in the book.",__label__1
"Very Uplifting and Fun: I really enjoyed Under the Tuscan Sun. Diane Lane is wonderful in this movie. Sandra Oh is great as her friend dealing with motherhood. Watching the scenes of Italian countryside is wonderful. Watching Diane Lanes character as she gets over her divorce, and moves to a foreign country by herself is inspiring.",__label__2
Heart warming movie: I saw the movie last night in a preview showing. I found it to be very charming. The best part of the movie by far is the cinematography. Tuscany and Italy in general are both places that I have never been before but just seeing this movie makes me want to go there all the more. I felt that the story line of this movie has a few holes but otherwise is very entertaining. My reccomendation would be to see this movie in a matine or wait until it comes out on video.,__label__2
"YAWN!: I eagerly anticipated watching this movie, as I thoroughly enjoyed the book; however, the movie shares only a passing resemblance to the book. It gets 2 stars because I enjoy Diane Lane and Tuscany is gorgeous, but other than that the movie was dull, Lane's character is nothing short of pathetic, and the ending is trite.",__label__1
"Does not follow the book much. Had to insert all the PC garbage.: Not bad entertainment...but the book is better, at least according to my wife who chose the movie after reading the book.",__label__1
"Enjoyable escapism: Fun and light but, a bit unrealistic. Just let go and enjoy! Diane Lane and Sandra Oh are great! Linsay Duncan steals the movie!",__label__2
"Movie night: Well, this was a perfect ending to a long busy day. I ordered the movie under the Tucson Sun to sit back and relax. It was very very enjoyable. I'm saying all this in a long-winded way because this review requires I write 20 words. This is actually kind of a pain because I am turned off about writing anything about these. But it was a fine purchase.",__label__2
"Nice scenery, but MAD CHEESIE storyline: I was pretty darn cheesed out by this movie. It's definitely nice to look at, and Diane Lane is a very lovely woman. However, the characters were all sugary sweet cheeseballs, and Diane Lane's character had no spine.Sandra Oh was great, as usual.",__label__1
"The Book is WAY Better..and That's all You Really Need to Know!: Don't waste your money on a DVD unless: 1) You just want to see beautiful Italian scenery (and it is gorgeous!) or 2) You actually enjoy watching a whiny, sniveling, pathetic female character waiting for a man to fulfill her life. Doubt if the author was thrilled with this version of her story. BUY THE BOOK!!! It's a great read.",__label__1
Terrible stinker!: What a stupid movie! There was nothign admirable in the main character. What the heck was she thinking in sleeping with a man she hadn't even known for a day! That is not realistic at all. The whole storyline had no logical sequence. Stay away from this movie.,__label__1
Good Movie: I love the full screen edition of the movie. I do not like the movies that is half screen. I like this movie because it reminds me that there is life after divorce or any other life altering event. But we have to move forward to achieve it.,__label__2
Couldn't Watch: I have been looking for this movie for a long while. It came and I put it in to watch it; it stopped playing 3/4 of the way through!!! I tried it in all of our devices and it did the same thing each time! Very disappointed!!!,__label__1
A Very Pleasant Story: Diane Lane gives a great performance in this romantic/fantasy driven movie. I know many people dream of going to another place to escape the pressures of daily life and this movie does that for you. If you like romantic movies in a far away land then this movie is for you.,__label__2
Feel Good Movie: Absolutely loved this movie. Great message ... unbelievably good things can happen ... even later in life. Breathtaking views of Italy ... This movie never loses its magic.,__label__2
"If you read the book, don't watch the movie!: I really enjoyed this book, but I was very disappointed by the movie. Rather than a story about the Italian countryside and the adventure of remodeling a home in a foreign country, this movie was about a divorced woman looking for love and her gay friend's dramatic life. Blah. I had wanted to see the charming Polish workers and the quaint Italian villages that were an important part of the original story. Oh well, this wasn't the movie for me.",__label__1
"If you liked the book, you will not like this film.: Unfortunately, the screenwriter completely changed the story of Under the Tuscan Sun. True, the main character did buy a villa in Tuscany. However, this story primarily concerns Diane Lane's trauma of divorce and trying to find herself in Italy. The film has very little about the trials of her renovation of the villa. Most importantly, the film says nothing about the book's description of life in a small Tuscan village and the people who live there. I was very disappointed in the film.",__label__1
"The biggest surprise of the year! This film is a marvel!: We'll I'm not usually one to go to see comedy-romance films but my girlfriend insisted and I was persuaded by the fact that Diane Lane (one of my favorite actresses) was starring in it. Honestly, this is a very good movie. It is one of the best surprises of the year. The film is edited in a way that never makes it seem boring or long-winded and the film is very (I mean very) entertaining, with some great dialog and some excellent comedy and well-timed laughs. A few times I was uncontrollably laughing it was so funny. The acting was amazing with Diane Lane giving one of her best performances in the lead role as Frances Mayes. The film looked great and had an excellent soundtrack as well. I recommend this film very much indeed, even to guys because it isn't cliched and slushy in the same way other romantic films are. It sure makes a great date movie - Under The Tuscan Sun is a marvel!",__label__2
"Guys miss this one: Gentlemen miss this movie. As a married man I am consigned to the fact that I must watch certain movies that are geared towards the ladies, I am okay with that. Having suffered through most of said type of movies, I can say that this particular movie is a truly a painful experience without any humor to help. All this movie does is follow a sad and lonely woman around Italy and waste the two hours that is the movie running time. Do not buy this movie for the lady in your life because then you will be forced to watch it.",__label__1
"One of the best chick flicks ever: Diane Lane is perfect. Plays the full range of female - bold, timid, snotty, exuberant and everything in between. Watch it!",__label__2
"Relationships in Tuscany: This is a lovely movie set in the stunning beauty of Tuscany. It deftly explores several types of relationships from that of a recent divorcee, to the break up of a gay union to young lovers in a Romeo and Juliet type romance. The divorcee finally discovers that a meaningful relationship doesn't depend on one person but a variety of people. Well worth seeing - you will enjoy it!",__label__2
"Quite a change from the book: Yes, you get lovely views of Tuscany and yes, she is renovating a run down villa. Otherwise, it is pretty much a new story. For those who loved the book, just make that mental adjustment and start with a fresh slate and you will enjoy the parallel blossoming in the movie of the woman and her house.I took off one star since it put my husband to sleep, but I found it a pleasant enough romance with good scenery. The main character is lovely and the various subplots such as the Polish laborer romancing a local girl expands the story to pull in the younger audience, I presume.",__label__2
"Beautiful People. Beautiful Scenery. Not so beautiful Plot: Beautiful Scenery. Beautiful People. Thin Plot. Diane Lane is gorgeous in this film and her performance was excellent - she just needed a better script to work with. Her friendship with the men who remodel her house is one of the good things in the film. Much of the rest of the film is just too much escapism for me. Why do movies seem to always portray the solution to pain and heartache as running away and starting a new life? I would think that if I was hurting - the last thing I would want is to be thousands of miles away from my closest friends and family. And in a new culture, where I didn't speak the language?",__label__1
"Very charming warm movie on a cold winter Saturday afternoon: This movie is very warm toned and sincere. I really give a lot of credit to film makers who can create a romantic comedy that is not contrived and unoriginal. Under the Tuscan Sun is a fresh romantic comedy that has a heart.Of course this is not a masterpiece that will change your perception of life and leave you breathless, but it will leave you smiling for at least a half an hour after it is over.Also, it has a really good point. So many times we force things to happen in our lives and and become totally frustrated in the process. It is indeed so much easier to just ""fall asleep and let the ladybugs crawl all over you"". You will see what I mean when you watch the movie.Highly recommended enterntainment.",__label__2
"Great Movie: My only complaint is the length of time it took to arrive. Could not use a gift as planned. Somehow, shipping needs to be speedier!!!",__label__2
Great movie for you and your gal friends to watch together!: Pop the popcorn. Open a bottle of wine. Call your girlfriends and to come over and watch this movie and have a little party. This is a great girl movie!! Diane Lane is great in this movie and it really is all about her....and she carries this movie so well. You will enjoy meeting the people that come in and out of her life on her journey through life and her journey to Tuscany. Call your friends and let this movie entertain you!!,__label__2
"Enjoyable & Light: When I go to the movies, I go to relax and enjoy a break from everday life. Who cares if it is realisitc or not. Being a romantic comedy buff, I found this movie entertaining and refreshing. Anyone who wants to enjoy a light movie will enjoy this film.",__label__2
"Boring!!!: This is supposed to be a romantic comedy, yet there are no comic moments. I could see the potential for comedy, but it just wasn't there. Maybe it's Diane Lane or maybe it's the director. I kept wondering if Lane was playing a teenager or an adult. I couldn't get involved with the character at all. She seemed to be faking it all the way through. I would've given no stars, but I thought the Italian countryside deserved at least 1 star.",__label__1
"Charming surprise...: This is such a feel-good film. Diane lane does a wonderful job playing the woman who leaves behind everything and starts over new. The people she meets, the scenery, the neuroses are all charming in their own way. Where Eat, Pray, Love failed, this film succeeded. A woman sets out to find herself after a personal disappointment, but rather than the whiny arrogant character of Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love, Diane Lane's character has a relatable warmth and energy despite her situation. i highly recommend this film for a rainy day.",__label__2
"Opposing View of Divorce: The heart break and loss from a womans point of view,abused by the court system, robbed of her hard earned home and possessons to a new and very different life in a strange country and different culture. Ms. Lanes best effort in an attention holding and often surprising, recovery. Beautiful scenery and superior directing make this one of movie lands best kept secrets.",__label__2
"Undercover?: I thoroughly enjoyed watching another T.V. while this show was playing out in the family room. The wife got a good night sleep and didn't even bother to replay the part she missed. After complaining, Hollywood Video gave us a comp, so all in all, we felt like we got our money's worth.",__label__1
"Good flick: Yes i'm a guy and yes i enjoy chic flicks from time to time,so sue me.This is a good film from Diane Lane(best known for her great performance in Unfaithful)which was also the first flim i recall her having a main staring role.I won't get in to deep to the story but she is a recent divorcy,whom feels she can't go on living in San Fransico,so her 2 gay lesbian friends convince her to go on an all gay trip to tuscan(italy).While there she becomes intrigued by a 300 year old italian home,mind you nothing works,and its in pretty sad shape.So she hires contractor's to help her with her project,and all along the way she runs into various men whom you think she'll develop an attraction to and maybe more but it never pan's out.So thats all i'll give for now,watch for yourself.Although it seems a little slow in places it's an entertaining little piece of film none the less.",__label__2
Boring: This movie was very boring and hard to get into. I started falling asleep in the first fifteen minutes. It's a very chick flick type of movie and I suggest men do not see it.,__label__1
"Are you KIDDING ME????: Frances Mayes sold out! She sold the title of her best seller book to hollywood and they used it to create romance novel drivel! It contains very little her sweet, beautiful tribute to Tuscany. What a shame! While I liked Diane Lane I was completely disappointed in this movie.",__label__1
"Boring, Drawn Out Movie: I watched the movie before reading the book. The movie was so bad that I felt compelled to read the book to see if it could redeem itself. The characters as depicted in the movie were very one dimensional and I just didn't care about them or what happened to them. The book tells a totally different story than is depicted in the movie and is SO MUCH BETTER.",__label__1
"Magnificent movie! Diane Lane shines!: A truly magnificent movie. Diane Lane shines in her role as Frances Mayes in this funny, sweet, enjoyable piece of great entertainment. The director makes this movie so engrossing and enjoyable that it is impossible to not be drawn into the wonderfully realized 3D characters and the brilliant played out scenes. The scenic locations help and so does the likable characters. Make no mistake... this is a magnificent movie.",__label__2
"Exceptional film - genuinely funny, moving and entertaining: Genuinely funny and moving - exceptional film.This is an exceptional film that shows that no matter what life throws at you, the human spirit can survive and make a comeback. I love films that show you the inner strength of the human spirit and peoples faith. The film is genuinely affecting - it is funny, very moving and it looks exceptional on a big screen. Most of all though this film entertains without resorting to cliches and melodrama. Diane Lane is exceptional and deserves Oscar recognition for creating such a three dimensional and believable heroine. The acting from everyone is first rate and the direction is fresh and infectious. An exceptional film!",__label__2
"Stupid movie: I was extremely disappointed with this movie. The story had no sense of direction. It seemed too badly glued together, as if the scriptwriters were just adding more things as they went along, saying, ""we'll make her a divorced woman...and then we'll make her go on a gay tour...and oh wait, let's make her have no morals and have sex with a man she hasn't known for even one day...and lets make her flirt with the married real estate man."" All in all, the story turned out to be pretty stupid with nothing to admire in the main character.",__label__1
"If it was not for Diane Lane....: If it was not for Diane Lane, this movie would have been a total loser. It's a swindle. It's advertised as ""romantic comedy"", when there is little (if any) comedy. It's boring, it portrays the Italians with all the cliches available. Blegh!",__label__1
"Tuscany steals the show: This title was on my Amazon recommended list, and since I never heard of it before I decided to pick it up.In short, I think ANY movie would benefit from being set and shot in Tuscany Italy. This one did. Without the beautiful backdrop - I don't think I would have watched the whole thing. A patchwork story-line, left me with the feeling that it had a lot of interesting bits and pieces BUT it appeared that they were put together for no apparent reason.It just wasn't believable.Maybe rent it",__label__1
"Diane Lane feast...: Man, hardly have I watched a movie this long (one hour and 53 minutes) that portrays the leading character in every (I mean, every!!) single scene, every single second of the whole movie!This is a bonus if you are a Diane Lane fan (and who is not? The woman is simply gorgeous, besides being a very good actress!), but otherwise youl will be imersed in a chick flick all along, and a bad one by the way, one that will lead you absolutely nowhere.",__label__1
"Ho-Hum: One of the biggest disappointments I have seen in some time. My main complaint is when I see a theatrical trailer for a movie, and that rrailer implies the movie is a comedy, and then the movie does not deliver what the trailer seems to have promised, I hit the ceiling.There are characters in this movie who's inclusion makes no sense since they don't advance the plot and don't really come off as amusing either.The whole premise of buying a house in a foreign country in which you barely speak the language makes no sense either.I don't know -- maybe it's me -- it seems like the time would have been better spent watching a travel film on Tuscany.Ho-HUM!!",__label__1
"barely cosi cosi (so so): This might be an ok movie to watch on a weekend when you're bored and have absolutely nothing better to do. Of course it's nothing like the book. It's terribly contrived with some very unlikely scenes. For example, there's this one scene where the long-haired Chinese man that shows up for an extended visit after his girlfriend dumps him actually gives birth. That just can't happen in real life!! Guys can't get pregant (yet)!! Anyway, forget about the movie. Read the book.",__label__1
