DESCRIPTION

Data: Book Reviews


Description of data: The data is available in a file named 'book_reviews.csv'. This data must be read and saved into a DataFrame using Python.


The data consists of two features, text and label respectively. 'text' consists of review comments and 'label' consists of one of the two encoded values, '__label__1' or '__label__2' where '__label__1' represents negative sentiment and '__label__2' represents positive sentiment.


Task: You, as a Data Scientist, have to analyse this data using techniques from NLP and Machine Learning as per the steps mentioned below:

Questions:

Note: Refer the 'Output Format' section for details on all output files to be created.

1. Read the data using the steps provided while writing the code and store it in a DataFrame. Write the total number of rows of the DataFrame to an output file.
2. Count the number of terms generated from this data by following the below steps:
3. Use TweetTokenizer to create tokens from 'text' column
4. Use CountVectorizer to create ngrams
5. Set analyzer as 'word'
6. Use words by converting them to lowercase
7. Create unigrams (set the appropriate ngram_range)
8. Write the number of unigrams generated above to an output file
9. Split the DataFrame into Train/Test using the steps described below:
10. Use 'text' as independent variable
11. Use 'label' as dependent variable
12. Split in the ratio Train/Test = 70/30
13. Use random_state = 100
14. Perform Vectorization using steps described below:
15. Use an appropriate vectorizer and apply it to transform both X_train and X_test (Save the results into X_train_idf & X_test_idf respectively)
16. Set max_features=1000
17. Calculate IDF weights for all the extracted features
18. Sort the IDF weights and write the 5 highest IDF values to an output file
19. Perform Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification on the data using steps described below:
	a) Create a model by fitting it to X_train_idf and y_train
	b) Predict values of y using X_test_idf
	c) Calculate accuracy of this model
	d) Write the value of accuracy rounded to 3 decimal places
	e) Calculate confusion matrix using predicted and testing values of y and write the matrix to an output file
